# Web Resource Approach - Simpler Alternative to Custom Page

## Problem
Custom Pages cannot be automated - they require manual creation in Power Apps Studio.

## Solution
Create an HTML Web Resource that:
1. Uses the PCF control's **React components directly**
2. Styled with **Fluent UI v9** (same as PCF)
3. Fully automated deployment
4. Opened via `Xrm.Navigation.openWebResource()`

## Architecture

```
Ribbon Button Click
  ↓
sprk_subgrid_commands.js (gets parent context)
  ↓
Xrm.Navigation.openWebResource() opens HTML page
  ↓
HTML page loads React bundle (from PCF build output)
  ↓
React app renders DocumentUploadForm component
  ↓
Same UI as PCF control (Fluent UI v9)
```

## Implementation Options

### Option A: Reuse PCF React Components (Recommended)
- Extract React components from PCF
- Create standalone HTML page
- Import bundle.js from PCF build
- Single codebase, dual deployment

###Option B: Separate React App
- Create new React app
- Copy components from PCF
- Build separate bundle
- More maintenance

## Next Steps

1. Create HTML page that imports PCF's bundle.js
2. Initialize React root with parameters from URL
3. Deploy HTML as Web Resource
4. Update ribbon button to use `openWebResource()`

This gives us:
- ✅ Full automation
- ✅ Same Fluent UI v9 styling
- ✅ Reuses existing PCF code
- ✅ Easy deployment

Would you like me to implement this approach?
