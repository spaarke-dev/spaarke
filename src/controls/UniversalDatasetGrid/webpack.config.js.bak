/**
 * Custom Webpack configuration for Universal Dataset Grid PCF control
 *
 * Purpose: Externalize React and ReactDOM to reduce bundle size
 *
 * By marking React/ReactDOM as externals, webpack will NOT bundle them
 * into bundle.js. Instead, the control expects these libraries to be
 * available in the runtime environment.
 *
 * Expected outcome:
 * - bundle.js will NOT include React/ReactDOM code
 * - Significant bundle size reduction (from ~10 MB to < 1 MB)
 * - Runtime environment must provide React/ReactDOM
