# SDAP Shared Client - Future Project Briefing

**Package:** `@spaarke/sdap-client`
**Current Status:** ✅ Built, Tested & Documented | ⏸️ Awaiting Integration
**Created:** October 4, 2025
**Documented:** December 2, 2025

---

## Quick Start (For Future Developers)

**If you're picking up this project in the future, start here:**

### What is This?

A **reusable TypeScript library** for file operations (upload, download, delete) that works across:
- ✅ PCF Controls (Dataverse)
- ✅ Office.js Add-ins (Word/Excel/PowerPoint)
- ✅ Web Applications (React/Angular/Vue)

### Why Does This Exist?

**Problem:** Each PCF control implements its own HTTP client for the BFF API (~300-400 lines each)
**Solution:** Centralize into a single, tested, platform-agnostic npm package

### Key Features

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| **Chunked Upload** | Upload files up to 250GB (320KB chunks) |
| **Progress Tracking** | Updates every 320KB (not just per-file) |
| **Platform Agnostic** | Works in browsers, no PCF/Dataverse dependencies |
| **Type Safe** | Full TypeScript definitions |
| **Tested** | 80%+ coverage with Jest |
| **Zero Dependencies** | Pure browser APIs (fetch, Blob, File) |

## Known Limitations & Gaps

### Current Limitations

| Limitation | Impact | Solution | Priority |
|------------|--------|----------|----------|
| No preview/editor operations | Can't migrate SpeFileViewer | Add PreviewOperation (Phase 3) | 🟡 Medium |
| No correlation ID support | Can't track requests end-to-end | Add header support | 🟡 Medium |
| No 401 retry logic | Auth failures not auto-recovered | Add retry with cache clear | 🟢 Low |
| No replaceFile() method | Can't replace files | Add method (delete + upload) | 🟢 Low |
| Token injection not ideal | Passing token to each method | Refactor to dependency injection | 🟢 Low |

### Missing Features (Not Blockers)

- Batch upload optimization
- Upload resume after network failure
- Compression before upload
- Virus scanning integration
- Duplicate file detection

## Decision Points

### Question 1: When Should We Migrate?

**Options:**

**A) Now (This Sprint)**
- ✅ Pro: Remove 100MB limit immediately
- ✅ Pro: Code consolidation now
- ❌ Con: Adds scope to current work

**B) Next Sprint**
- ✅ Pro: Focused migration effort
- ✅ Pro: More testing time
- ❌ Con: 100MB limit persists

**C) When We Need 100MB+ Files**
- ✅ Pro: Demand-driven
- ❌ Con: Reactive approach
- ❌ Con: Technical debt accumulates

**Recommendation:** **Option B (Next Sprint)** - Focused effort with proper testing

---

### Question 2: Should We Publish to Azure Artifacts Now?

**Options:**

**A) Yes, Publish Now**
- ✅ Pro: Proper npm workflow
- ✅ Pro: Versioning support
- ❌ Con: Overhead if not used soon

**B) No, Use Local Reference**
- ✅ Pro: Simpler for testing
- ✅ Pro: Faster iteration
- ❌ Con: Not scalable long-term

**Recommendation:** **Option B (Local Reference)** until Phase 4 (Office.js add-ins)

---

### Question 3: Should We Enhance for Phase 8 Now?

**Options:**

**A) Yes, Add Preview/Editor Now**
- ✅ Pro: Complete solution
- ✅ Pro: Migrate both controls together
- ❌ Con: 2-3 weeks extra work

**B) No, Wait Until Needed**
- ✅ Pro: Focus on Universal Quick Create first
- ✅ Pro: Learn from first migration
- ❌ Con: SpeFileViewer waits longer

**Recommendation:** **Option B (Wait)** - Prove value with Universal Quick Create first

## Technical Architecture Reference

### Core Classes

```typescript
// Main client
class SdapApiClient {
    constructor(config: SdapClientConfig)
    uploadFile(containerId, file, options): Promise<DriveItem>
    downloadFile(driveId, itemId): Promise<Blob>
    deleteFile(driveId, itemId): Promise<void>
    getFileMetadata(driveId, itemId): Promise<FileMetadata>
}

// Token abstraction (override per platform)
abstract class TokenProvider {
    abstract getToken(): Promise<string>
}

// Operations (internal)
class UploadOperation {
    uploadSmall(containerId, file): Promise<DriveItem>      // < 4MB
    uploadChunked(containerId, file): Promise<DriveItem>    // ≥ 4MB
}

class DownloadOperation {
    download(driveId, itemId): Promise<Blob>
}

class DeleteOperation {
    delete(driveId, itemId): Promise<void>
}
```

### API Endpoints Used

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| PUT | `/api/containers/{id}/files/{path}` | Upload file <4MB |
| POST | `/api/containers/{id}/upload` | Create upload session (≥4MB) |
