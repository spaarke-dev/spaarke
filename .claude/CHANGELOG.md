# Procedure-Surface Changelog

> **Forward-only from 2026-05-14.** No back-fill from history.

This file tracks changes to the agent-procedure surface — `.claude/skills/`, `.claude/agents/`, `.claude/settings.json`, `.claude/patterns/`, `.claude/constraints/`, `.claude/FAILURE-MODES.md`, and the root `CLAUDE.md`. Git history covers everything; this file is the **curated** view that a human (or future agent) can scan to answer "when did skill X change?" or "when did hooks last get fixed?" without bisecting commits.

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) conventions.

## How to maintain this

**Every PR that touches** `.claude/skills/`, `.claude/agents/`, `.claude/settings.json`, `.claude/patterns/`, `.claude/constraints/`, `.claude/FAILURE-MODES.md`, or the root `CLAUDE.md` **MUST add an entry to the `[Unreleased]` section below** before merge.

- One entry per logical change. Cite the commit SHA or PR number.
- Use the categories: **Added**, **Changed**, **Deprecated**, **Removed**, **Fixed**.
- "Bumped version" and trivial typo fixes can be omitted.
- When a project releases (a `work/<project>` branch merges to master), promote `[Unreleased]` to `[<project-name>] - <date>` and start a fresh `[Unreleased]`.

If you're not sure whether to add an entry, add one. Too granular is better than missing.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- (project deliverables for ai-procedure-quality-r1 land here as they ship — see the planned entry below)

## [ai-procedure-quality-r1] - planned for 2026-05-XX

> Entry will be promoted from `[Unreleased]` when the project's PR #294 merges. The deliverables below are the planned set.

### Added
- `.claude/agents/researcher.md` — Opus, effort: high researcher subagent for deep-dive Microsoft platform investigation; accumulates findings via project memory (`MEMORY.md`). Per design.md Directive 1. (Task 010)
- `.claude/skills/_template/SKILL.md` — canonical skill scaffold enforcing the 7 best practices; new skills clone this; existing skills are measured against it during Phase 2a audit. (Task 011)
- `.claude/CHANGELOG.md` — this file. Forward-only convention. (Task 012)
- `.claude/FAILURE-MODES.md` — repo-level catalog of cross-cutting failure patterns. 4 inaugural entries derived from 2026-05-14 incidents. (Task 013)
- `.claude/archive/` directory with date-organized subdirectory convention; reversibility-first removal pattern. (Task 014)
- `scripts/quality/Validate-SkillReferences.ps1` — Light reference check across all 49 skills (file paths, URLs, skill names). Runs in CI; <10s. (Task 065)
- `scripts/quality/Find-SkillReferenceDrift.ps1` — 7-surface drift detector; catches broken refs after rename/split/merge. (Task 066)

### Changed
- Root `CLAUDE.md` rewritten to the tiered target (<200 lines). Reference content moved to subdirectories. The pre-rewrite version is preserved in `.claude/archive/2026-05-14/CLAUDE.md`. (Phase 3b deliverable)
- Multiple skills refined per `.claude/AUDIT-FINDINGS-SKILLS.md`. Specific refactors listed under each skill in the per-skill section of the audit findings. (Phase 2b deliverable)

### Removed
- Skills audit-recommended-and-approved for removal (specific list determined at Human Gate 1). Folders archived to `.claude/archive/2026-05-14/skills/<name>/`, not deleted from disk. (Phase 2b deliverable)

### Fixed
- N/A — Phase 0 inventory surfaced existing issues (5 failing workflows, 3 PCFs with wrong `build:prod`, etc.) but their fixes are in separate scope from this project.
