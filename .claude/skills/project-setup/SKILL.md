## Purpose

**Tier 1 Component Skill** - Generates foundational project artifact files (README.md, PLAN.md, CLAUDE.md) and folder structure from a design specification. This is a pure artifact generator that does NOT perform resource discovery, branching, or task creation.

**Design Philosophy**:
- Single responsibility: artifact generation only
- No side effects (no git operations, no external calls)
- Deterministic: same input → same output
- Composable: can be called by orchestrator skills

## When to Use

**Primary Use**: Called by orchestrator skills (e.g., project-pipeline)

**Standalone Use** (Advanced):
- Need project artifacts but will create tasks manually
- Rebuilding artifacts after deletion
- Want full control over each step of project initialization
- Learning how the project structure works

**Do NOT use if**:
- You want full automated setup → Use **project-pipeline** instead
- You need task files created → Use **project-pipeline** or **task-create**
- You want resource discovery (ADRs, skills) → Use **project-pipeline** instead

## Inputs Required

| Input | Required | Source |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Project path | Yes | Path to `projects/{project-name}/` folder |
| Design specification | Yes | Must exist at `projects/{project-name}/spec.md` |

### Design Spec Location

The design specification must live at:
```
projects/{project-name}/spec.md
```

**Prerequisites (must be done before invoking this skill)**:
1. Create folder: `projects/{descriptive-project-name}/`
2. Place spec: `projects/{project-name}/spec.md`
3. Invoke: `/project-setup projects/{project-name}`

## Workflow

### Step 1: Validate Inputs

```
IF project path provided:
  EXTRACT project-name from folder name
ELSE:
  ASK user for project path

IF projects/{project-name}/spec.md does NOT exist:
  → STOP - "spec.md not found. Please create projects/{project-name}/spec.md first."

IF projects/{project-name}/README.md already exists:
  → WARN - "Project already initialized. Continue anyway?"
  → Offer to view existing project or re-initialize
```

### Step 2: Load Templates and Context

```
LOAD templates:
  - docs/ai-knowledge/templates/project-README.template.md
  - docs/ai-knowledge/templates/project-plan.template.md

LOAD projects/{project-name}/spec.md

EXTRACT from spec:
  - Problem statement
  - Proposed solution
  - Scope (in-scope / out-of-scope)
  - Success criteria / acceptance criteria
  - Technical constraints
  - Key requirements
```

### Step 3: Create Folder Structure

```
projects/{project-name}/
├── spec.md            # Design specification (input - already exists)
├── README.md          # Project overview (generated)
├── plan.md            # Implementation plan (generated)
├── CLAUDE.md          # AI context file for this project (generated)
├── tasks/             # Task files go here
│   └── .gitkeep
└── notes/             # Ephemeral working files
    ├── .gitkeep
    ├── debug/         # Debugging session artifacts
    ├── spikes/        # Exploratory code/research
    ├── drafts/        # Work-in-progress content
    └── handoffs/      # Context reset summaries
```

**Notes directory purpose**: Store temporary artifacts during development (debug logs, spike code, drafts, handoff summaries). Contents are ephemeral and may be removed after project completion by repo-cleanup skill.

### Step 4: Generate README.md

Use `project-README.template.md` structure:

**Required Sections**:
- **Title**: Project name in Title Case (derived from folder name)
- **Quick Links**: Pre-fill with relative paths:
  - `plan.md`
  - `tasks/TASK-INDEX.md`
  - `spec.md`
- **Overview**: High-level summary (2-3 sentences extracted from spec)
- **Problem Statement**: Direct copy from design spec "Problem" or "Background" section
- **Proposed Solution**: High-level approach from spec "Solution" or "Approach" section
- **Scope**:
  - In-scope items (bulleted list from spec)
  - Out-of-scope items (bulleted list from spec)
- **Graduation Criteria**: Success criteria from spec as measurable checklist

**Template Guidance**:
- Keep README readable in under 2 minutes
- Use present tense ("This project provides...")
- Make graduation criteria measurable (not vague like "improve performance")

### Step 5: Generate plan.md

Use `project-plan.template.md` structure:

**Required Sections**:

1. **Executive Summary**
   - Purpose (what and why)
   - Scope (boundaries)
   - Timeline estimate (based on complexity)

2. **Architecture Context**
   - Key architectural constraints from spec
   - Technology stack
   - Integration points

3. **Implementation Approach**
   - Phase structure overview
   - Critical path
   - Dependencies

4. **WBS (Work Breakdown Structure)**
   - Create phases based on spec sections:

   | Spec Section | Generates Phase |
   |--------------|-----------------|
   | Data Model | Phase: Data Model & Schema Setup |
   | API Endpoints | Phase: API Development |
   | UI Components | Phase: Frontend Development |
   | PCF Controls | Phase: PCF Control Implementation |
   | Integration | Phase: Integration & Wiring |
   | Security | Phase: Authentication & Authorization |
   | Testing | Phase: Testing & Validation |
   | Deployment | Phase: Deployment & Go-Live |

   - Each phase should have:
     - Phase number and title
     - Objectives (what will be achieved)
     - Key deliverables (concrete outputs)
     - Inputs (what's needed to start)
     - Outputs (what's produced)
     - Dependencies (other phases or external factors)

5. **Dependencies**
   - External dependencies (services, APIs, resources)
   - Internal dependencies (shared libraries, components)

6. **Testing Strategy**
   - Unit testing approach
   - Integration testing approach
   - Acceptance testing approach

7. **Acceptance Criteria**
   - Copy from graduation criteria in README
   - Add verification steps

8. **Risk Register**
   - Extract risks from spec constraints
   - Add mitigation strategies

9. **Next Steps**
   - Immediate next actions
   - Reference to task creation

**Estimation Guidance** (for timeline in Executive Summary):
- Base estimate on WBS phases and spec complexity
- Don't include specific dates (user controls timeline)
- Express as effort range (e.g., "Estimated effort: 15-20 days")

### Step 6: Generate CLAUDE.md

Create project-specific AI context file:

```markdown
# {Project Name} - AI Context

> **Purpose**: This file provides context for Claude Code when working on {project-name}.
> **Always load this file first** when working on any task in this project.

---

## Project Status

- **Phase**: Planning
- **Last Updated**: {YYYY-MM-DD}
- **Current Task**: Not started
- **Next Action**: Run task-create to decompose plan into task files

---

## Quick Reference

### Key Files
- [`spec.md`](spec.md) - Original design specification (permanent reference)
- [`README.md`](README.md) - Project overview and graduation criteria
- [`plan.md`](plan.md) - Implementation plan and WBS
- [`tasks/TASK-INDEX.md`](tasks/TASK-INDEX.md) - Task tracker (will be created by task-create)

### Project Metadata
- **Project Name**: {project-name}
- **Type**: {API/PCF/Plugin/Integration/etc. - from spec}
- **Complexity**: {Low/Medium/High - from spec analysis}

---

## Context Loading Rules

When working on this project, Claude Code should:

1. **Always load this file first** when starting work on any task
2. **Reference spec.md** for design decisions, requirements, and acceptance criteria
3. **Load the relevant task file** from `tasks/` based on current work
4. **Apply ADRs** relevant to the technologies used (loaded automatically via adr-aware)

---

## Key Technical Constraints

{Extract key constraints from spec.md, examples:}
- Must use .NET 8 Minimal API (no Azure Functions) - per ADR-001
- PCF controls must use Fluent UI v9 - per ADR-006
- No HTTP calls from Dataverse plugins - per ADR-002
- Redis-first caching strategy - per ADR-009

---

## Decisions Made

<!-- Log key architectural/implementation decisions here as project progresses -->
<!-- Format: Date, Decision, Rationale, Who -->

*No decisions recorded yet*

---

## Implementation Notes

<!-- Add notes about gotchas, workarounds, or important learnings during implementation -->

*No notes yet*

---

## Resources

### Applicable ADRs
{List ADRs relevant to this project - to be filled in by project-pipeline or manually}

### Related Projects
{List related projects if any}

### External Documentation
{Links to external docs, APIs, SDKs relevant to this project}

---

*This file should be kept updated throughout project lifecycle*
```

### Step 7: Output Summary

```
✅ Project artifacts created: projects/{project-name}/

Files generated:
  ✅ README.md - Project overview and graduation criteria
  ✅ plan.md - Implementation plan with WBS
  ✅ CLAUDE.md - AI context file
  ✅ tasks/.gitkeep - Task folder (empty, ready for task-create)
  ✅ notes/.gitkeep - Notes folder with subdirectories
  ✅ notes/debug/.gitkeep
  ✅ notes/spikes/.gitkeep
  ✅ notes/drafts/.gitkeep
  ✅ notes/handoffs/.gitkeep

Existing files (not modified):
  📄 spec.md - Design specification (input)

Next steps:
  1. Review README.md and plan.md for accuracy
  2. Run /task-create to decompose plan into executable task files
  3. Or use /project-pipeline to automate the full pipeline

Note: This skill does NOT create:
  ❌ Task files (use task-create or project-pipeline)
  ❌ Feature branch (use project-pipeline or manual git commands)
  ❌ Resource discovery (use project-pipeline for ADR/skill/knowledge loading)
```

## What This Skill Does NOT Do

To maintain single responsibility, this skill explicitly does NOT:

- ❌ **Resource Discovery**: Does not search for related ADRs, skills, or knowledge docs (use project-pipeline for this)
- ❌ **Task Creation**: Does not create task files (use task-create or project-pipeline)
- ❌ **Feature Branching**: Does not create git branches (use project-pipeline or manual git)
- ❌ **Git Commits**: Does not commit files (handled by orchestrators or manual)
- ❌ **Task Execution**: Does not execute tasks (use task-execute)

These responsibilities belong to orchestrator skills (like project-pipeline) or should be done manually.

## Conventions

### Naming
- Project folder: `kebab-case` (e.g., `sdap-refactor`, `ai-document-intelligence-r1`)
- Files: lowercase with hyphens
- No abbreviations in project names unless well-known (e.g., `sdap`, `spe`, `ai`)

### Content Standards
- README.md: Readable in under 2 minutes
- plan.md: WBS phases map to logical milestones
- Each phase: 3-7 deliverables (decompose further if more)
- CLAUDE.md: Keep updated as project progresses

### Graduation Criteria Requirements
Every project must have measurable graduation criteria:
- ✅ At least one functional requirement (feature works as specified)
- ✅ At least one quality requirement (tests pass, no regressions)
- ✅ Optional: performance, security, documentation requirements
- ❌ NO vague criteria like "improve performance" or "better UX"

## Resources

### Templates (Auto-loaded)
- `docs/ai-knowledge/templates/project-README.template.md`
- `docs/ai-knowledge/templates/project-plan.template.md`

### Related Skills
- **project-pipeline**: Orchestrator that calls this skill (RECOMMENDED for most users)
- **task-create**: Creates task files from plan.md (run after this skill)
- **task-execute**: Executes individual tasks (run after task-create)

## Integration with Other Skills

### Called By (Upstream)
- **project-pipeline** - Calls this skill at Step 2 after resource discovery

### Calls (Downstream)
- None (this is a component skill with no dependencies)

### Complements
- **task-create** - Natural next step after using this skill
- **repo-cleanup** - Validates structure created by this skill at project end

## Examples

### Example 1: Standalone Use (Advanced)

**Trigger**: `/project-setup projects/sdap-refactor`

**Prerequisites**:
```
projects/sdap-refactor/
└── spec.md  (created by user, 2000 words, has all required sections)
```

**Result**:
```
projects/sdap-refactor/
├── spec.md             # Input (existed before)
├── README.md           # Generated - project overview
├── plan.md             # Generated - 6 phases, WBS structure
├── CLAUDE.md           # Generated - AI context
├── tasks/.gitkeep
└── notes/
    ├── .gitkeep
    ├── debug/
    ├── spikes/
    ├── drafts/
    └── handoffs/
```

**Next Action**: User manually runs `/task-create projects/sdap-refactor`

---

### Example 2: Called by Orchestrator

**Trigger**: User runs `/project-pipeline projects/ai-doc-summary`

**Process**:
```
project-pipeline Step 1: Validate spec.md ✅
project-pipeline Step 2: Resource discovery ✅
  → Found 4 ADRs, 2 skills, 3 guides

project-pipeline Step 2 (continued): Generate artifacts
  → CALLS: project-setup projects/ai-doc-summary
    ✅ README.md created
    ✅ plan.md created
    ✅ CLAUDE.md created
  → project-setup returns

project-pipeline Step 3: Create tasks...
```

---

### Example 3: Missing Spec Error

**Trigger**: `/project-setup projects/new-feature`

**Result** (if spec.md doesn't exist):
```
❌ Cannot initialize: projects/new-feature/spec.md not found.

Please create the spec file first:
  1. Create folder: projects/new-feature/
  2. Add design spec: projects/new-feature/spec.md
     Required sections:
     - Executive Summary / Purpose
     - Problem Statement
     - Proposed Solution
     - Scope (in-scope / out-of-scope)
     - Success Criteria / Acceptance Criteria
  3. Re-run: /project-setup projects/new-feature

Or use /project-pipeline for full automated setup.
```

---

### Example 4: Already Initialized

**Trigger**: `/project-setup projects/existing-project`

**Result** (if README.md already exists):
```
⚠️  Warning: projects/existing-project/README.md already exists.

Options:
  1. 'continue' - Regenerate all files (will overwrite existing README, PLAN, CLAUDE.md)
  2. 'view' - Show existing README.md
  3. 'stop' - Cancel operation

[Your choice: continue / view / stop]
```

---

## Summary

**project-setup** is a **Tier 1 Component Skill** that generates project artifacts from a design specification. It is:
- ✅ Focused (artifact generation only)
- ✅ Deterministic (same input → same output)
- ✅ Reusable (called by orchestrators or standalone)
- ✅ Side-effect-free (no git operations, no external calls)

For most users, **use project-pipeline instead** - it orchestrates this skill along with resource discovery, task creation, and branching.

---

*For Claude Code: This is a component skill. If a user requests full project setup, recommend /project-pipeline instead of this skill directly.*
