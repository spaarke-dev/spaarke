# MSAL Client Pattern (DEPRECATED — Use `@spaarke/auth`)

> **Last Reviewed**: 2026-05-13
> **Status**: **Deprecated** — kept only as a reference for historical context
>
> **Canonical replacement**: [`spaarke-sso-binding.md`](spaarke-sso-binding.md) — the binding requirements + 6-strategy chain. All new code, and any rebuild of existing code, MUST use `@spaarke/auth` via that pattern.

## Why this pattern is deprecated

The legacy "direct MSAL singleton" pattern (a module-level `PublicClientApplication` + `msalConfig` constant + `acquireTokenPopup` fallback) was found in 2026-05-12 debugging to be the proximate cause of the "Pick an account" popup on every tab open. The defects in this pattern:

1. **Module-level config** — `msalConfig` runs at import time, before `Xrm.Utility.getGlobalContext().organizationSettings.tenantId` is populated. Forces hardcoded authority or `/organizations`, both of which break `ssoSilent`.
2. **Per-component singleton** — each PCF/Code Page creates its own MSAL instance. Tokens can't be shared with neighbors via `__spaarke_bff_token_cache__` or the parent-frame bridge. Every neighbor independently re-authenticates.
3. **`acquireTokenPopup` fallback** — fires the popup whenever silent fails, with no diagnostics to tell us WHICH silent attempt failed and why.

`SpaarkeAuthProvider` solves all three (singleton across components via `getAuthProvider()`, runtime-resolved tenant authority, 6-strategy chain with diagnostic logging).

## When you might still touch this pattern

Only when reading a legacy PCF source file that hasn't been migrated yet, to understand what it does before replacing it. The migration target is always the `@spaarke/auth` pattern.

## Migration path (when rebuilding a legacy PCF)

1. Remove `services/auth/MsalAuthProvider.ts` and `services/auth/msalConfig.ts`.
2. Add `@spaarke/auth` to `devDependencies` (`file:../../shared/Spaarke.Auth`).
3. Create `control/authInit.ts` calling `initAuth(config)` with the 5 required fields (clientId, redirectUri, bffApiScope, bffBaseUrl, proactiveRefresh). **Omit `authority`** — the library resolves it.
4. Move the auth init call from the PCF class's `init()` into the React component's `useEffect` (required for virtual ReactControl per ADR-022 + `/pcf-deploy` skill).
5. Replace direct `acquireTokenSilent/Popup` calls with `authenticatedFetch` from `@spaarke/auth`.

Reference exemplar: `src/client/pcf/SemanticSearchControl/SemanticSearchControl/authInit.ts` + `SemanticSearchControl.tsx`.
