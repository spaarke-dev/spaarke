# Standards Compliance Summary
## Container Type Registration - Microsoft SPE Standards

**Date:** 2025-10-09
**Reference:** [KM-SPE-WEB-APPLICATION-CONTAINER-TYPE-REGISTRATION.md](../../../docs/KM-SPE-WEB-APPLICATION-CONTAINER-TYPE-REGISTRATION.md)
**Status:** ‚úÖ **FULLY COMPLIANT** (after one permission grant)

---

## Executive Summary

Our approach to resolving the 403 Forbidden error is **fully compliant** with Microsoft SharePoint Embedded standards. The implementation matches all documented requirements for container type registration.

**One prerequisite missing:** PCF app needs `Container.Selected` app-only permission (easily granted in Azure Portal).

## Compliance Checklist

| Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| ‚úÖ Use SharePoint API (not Graph) | **Compliant** | `/_api/v2.1/storageContainerTypes/...` |
| ‚úÖ HTTP PUT method | **Compliant** | Script uses PUT |
| ‚úÖ Client credentials flow | **Compliant** | `grant_type: client_credentials` |
| ‚úÖ App-only token | **Compliant** | Using `.default` scope |
| ‚úÖ Correct JSON structure | **Compliant** | Matches documentation examples |
| ‚úÖ Guest app pattern | **Compliant** | BFF API as guest app |
| ‚úÖ Register both owner & guest | **Compliant** | **Script updated** |
| ‚úÖ Appropriate permissions | **Compliant** | WriteContent for file upload |
| ‚ùå Container.Selected permission | **REQUIRED** | PCF app needs this granted |
| ‚ö†Ô∏è Certificate authentication | **Recommended** | Using secret (OK for dev) |

## Key Findings from Standards Review

### 1. Our Diagnosis is Correct ‚úÖ

**Microsoft Documentation (Line 10):**
> "The registration API also grants access to other Guest Apps to interact with the owning application's containers."

**Our Approach:**
- BFF API is a "Guest App" that needs registration
- PCF app is the "Owning App" that performs registration
- This matches the documented guest app pattern exactly

### 2. Error Code Confirms Missing Permission ‚úÖ

**Microsoft Documentation (Line 85):**
> "401 - Request lacks valid authentication credentials"

**Our Error:**
- Getting 401 Unauthorized (not 403 Forbidden)
- 403 would mean "wrong app" - we get 401 which means "missing permission"
- Confirms PCF app IS the owner, just lacks Container.Selected

### 3. Script Update Required ‚úÖ

**Microsoft Example (Lines 129-151):**
```json
{
  "value": [
    { "appId": "owner-app", "delegated": ["full"], "appOnly": ["full"] },
    { "appId": "guest-app", "delegated": ["read", "write"], "appOnly": [] }
  ]
}
```

**Our Script:**
- **UPDATED** to register both PCF app (owner) and BFF API (guest)
- Prevents accidentally removing owner app permissions
- Matches Microsoft's Example 2 exactly

### 4. Permission Level is Appropriate ‚úÖ

**Microsoft Documentation (Line 50):**
> "WriteContent - Can write content to containers for this container type"

**Our Request:**
- `"delegated": ["WriteContent"]` for BFF API
- Appropriate for file upload via OBO flow
- Will test if ReadContent is implicitly included or must be explicit

## Standards Compliance Matrix

### API Endpoint

| Standard | Implementation | Compliant |
|----------|----------------|-----------|
| Base URL format | `https://spaarke.sharepoint.com` | ‚úÖ |
| API path | `/_api/v2.1/storageContainerTypes/{id}/applicationPermissions` | ‚úÖ |
| NOT Graph API | Using SharePoint API directly | ‚úÖ |

### Authentication

| Standard | Implementation | Compliant |
|----------|----------------|-----------|
| Client credentials flow | `grant_type: client_credentials` | ‚úÖ |
| Scope format | `https://spaarke.sharepoint.com/.default` | ‚úÖ |
| Token audience | SharePoint (not Graph) | ‚úÖ |
| Container.Selected permission | **Missing - needs grant** | ‚ùå ACTION |
| Service principal exists | PCF app in tenant | ‚úÖ |
| Admin consent | PCF app has consent | ‚úÖ |

### Request Format

| Standard | Implementation | Compliant |
|----------|----------------|-----------|
| HTTP method | PUT | ‚úÖ |
| Content-Type header | `application/json` | ‚úÖ |
| JSON structure | `{"value": [...]}` | ‚úÖ |
| App ID format | Valid GUIDs | ‚úÖ |
| Permission arrays | Delegated & AppOnly | ‚úÖ |

### Permission Model

| Standard | Implementation | Compliant |
|----------|----------------|-----------|
| Owning app included | PCF app with full permissions | ‚úÖ |
| Guest app included | BFF API with WriteContent | ‚úÖ |
| Delegated for OBO | Using delegated, not app-only | ‚úÖ |
| Appropriate level | WriteContent for file upload | ‚úÖ |

## Required Action

### Before Running Script

**Grant Container.Selected permission to PCF app:**

1. Azure Portal ‚Üí Azure Active Directory ‚Üí App Registrations
2. Find "Spaarke DSM-SPE Dev 2" (`170c98e1-d486-4355-bcbe-170454e0207c`)
3. API Permissions ‚Üí + Add a permission
4. SharePoint ‚Üí **Application permissions** ‚Üí Container.Selected
5. Grant admin consent ‚úì

**Then run:**
```powershell
.\scripts\Register-BffApiWithContainerType.ps1
```

---

## Production Recommendations

### 1. Certificate Authentication (Line 28)

**Current:** Using client secret
**Recommendation:** Migrate to certificate for production

**Why:** Certificates provide cryptographic proof of identity and cannot be copied like secrets.

**How:**
```powershell
# Generate certificate
$cert = New-SelfSignedCertificate -Subject "CN=PCF-SPE-Prod" -CertStoreLocation "Cert:\CurrentUser\My" -KeyExportPolicy Exportable -KeySpec Signature

# Upload to Azure AD
# Export as .pfx and upload to app registration

# Update script to use certificate
$assertion = [Convert]::ToBase64String($cert.GetRawCertData())
```

### 2. Key Vault for Secrets

**Current:** Secrets in script parameters
**Recommendation:** Store in Azure Key Vault

**Why:** Prevents secrets in code, provides audit trail, enables rotation.

### 3. Monitoring and Alerts

**Recommendation:** Log all container type registration changes

**Why:** Track who registered what apps and when (important for security audit).

---

## Testing Validation

### Expected Behavior After Registration

1. **Registration Call:**
   - Input: PUT with both apps
   - Expected: HTTP 200 OK
   - Response: Confirmation of both apps registered

2. **OBO Upload:**
   - Input: File upload with Token A
   - Expected: HTTP 200 OK (was 403)
   - Response: File metadata

3. **Application Insights:**
   - Expected: "OBO upload successful" logs
   - No more 403 errors

### If Still Getting Errors

| Error | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| 401 | Still missing Container.Selected | Verify permission granted and consent given |
| 403 | PCF app isn't owner | Need to find actual owning app |
| 404 | Container type doesn't exist | Verify container type ID |
| 400 | Bad request format | Check JSON payload |

Grant `Container.Selected` permission to PCF app in Azure Portal, then run the registration script.

### üéØ Expected Outcome

- Registration succeeds (HTTP 200)
- Both apps registered with correct permissions
- OBO file upload works (no more 403)
- 403 error completely resolved
