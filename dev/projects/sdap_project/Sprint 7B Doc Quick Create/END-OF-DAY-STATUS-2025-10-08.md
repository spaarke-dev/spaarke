# Sprint 7B - Document Quick Create - End of Day Status
**Date:** October 8, 2025
**Session Duration:** ~4 hours
**Status:** In Progress - Core functionality implemented, testing required

---

## 🎯 Sprint Goal
Build a Quick Create form with multi-file upload capability for Documents in Dataverse using PCF control.

---

## ✅ What Was Completed

### 1. PCF Control Development (UniversalQuickCreate v2.0.6)
- ✅ Built complete PCF control with MSAL authentication
- ✅ Implemented multi-file upload with drag-and-drop UI
- ✅ Added progress tracking and error handling
- ✅ Integrated with existing Spe.Bff.Api endpoints
- ✅ Production build optimized (571 KB bundle)
- ✅ Deployed to SPAARKE DEV 1 environment

### 2. Architecture Clarification
- ✅ Confirmed proper flow: `PCF → MSAL Token → Spe.Bff.Api → OBO/MI → SharePoint Embedded`
- ✅ No changes needed to Spe.Bff.Api (all endpoints already exist)
- ✅ Identified correct endpoint: `PUT /api/drives/{driveId}/upload?fileName={fileName}`

### 3. Key Files Modified
- `src/controls/UniversalQuickCreate/UniversalQuickCreate/`
  - `ControlManifest.Input.xml` - v2.0.6
  - `services/SdapApiClient.ts` - Corrected to use Drive ID endpoint
  - `services/MultiFileUploadService.ts` - Updated to extract Drive ID from form
  - `UniversalQuickCreatePCF.ts` - Version badge, MSAL integration
  - `components/FileUploadField.tsx` - Fluent UI v9 implementation

---

## ⚠️ Current Blockers / Issues

### 1. **Authentication Endpoint Mismatch**
**Issue:** The endpoint we're calling uses **Managed Identity** (service account), not **OBO (user identity)**

**Current Endpoint:**
```
PUT /api/drives/{driveId}/upload
Authorization: "canwritefiles" (Managed Identity)
```

**What It Does:**
- Uses service account credentials
- Doesn't preserve user permissions
- May work for testing but not production

**Alternative Options:**
- **Option A:** Use OBO container endpoint: `PUT /api/obo/containers/{containerId}/files/{fileName}`
  - Requires Container ID (not Drive ID)
  - Preserves user permissions
  - Need to get Container ID first

- **Option B:** Add OBO drive upload endpoint to Spe.Bff.Api
  - Would need to modify API (you said not to do this)

### 2. **Missing Container ID**
**Issue:** Form only has Drive ID, but OBO endpoint needs Container ID

**Drive ID (what we have):**
```
b!rAta3Ht_zEKl6AqiQObblUhqWZU646tBrEagKKMKiOcv-7Yo7739SKCuM2H-RPAy
```

**Container ID (what OBO endpoint needs):**
- Format: GUID like `8a6ce34c-6055-4681-8f87-2f4f9f921c06`
- Can be retrieved via: `GET /api/containers?containerTypeId={guid}`
- But this endpoint requires special auth

---

## 🔄 What Went Wrong (Learning Points)

### Architecture Confusion
1. **Started by trying to add new endpoints** to Spe.Bff.Api (WRONG)
   - You correctly said: "Don't change Spe.Bff.Api"
   - All endpoints already exist from previous sprints

2. **Confused Container ID vs Drive ID**
   - OBO endpoints use Container ID
   - MI endpoints use Drive ID
   - These are different identifiers

3. **Tried to call SPE directly** from PCF (WRONG)
   - PCF should ONLY call Spe.Bff.Api
   - Spe.Bff.Api handles all SPE communication

### Key Takeaway
The BFF API was already complete from Sprint 8. We just needed to:
1. Build PCF with MSAL auth
2. Call existing BFF endpoints
3. Handle responses

---

## 📋 Next Steps (Priority Order)

### Immediate (Tomorrow Morning)

**1. Decide on Authentication Approach**
   - [ ] **Option A:** Test with MI endpoint (current setup) to verify basic upload works
   - [ ] **Option B:** Switch to OBO container endpoint (requires Container ID solution)

**2. If Using MI Endpoint (Quick Test):**
   - [ ] Test upload with existing Drive ID
   - [ ] Verify file appears in SharePoint Embedded
   - [ ] Check if it works despite being service account upload

**3. If Using OBO Endpoint (Production Approach):**
   - [ ] Get Container ID (via BFF API or manual lookup)
   - [ ] Update PCF to call: `PUT /api/obo/containers/{containerId}/files/{fileName}`
   - [ ] Update form to use Container ID instead of Drive ID
   - [ ] Test upload preserves user permissions

### Follow-Up Tasks

**4. Container ID Lookup Solution**
   - [ ] Option A: Add dropdown to Quick Create that calls `GET /api/containers?containerTypeId={guid}`
   - [ ] Option B: Programmatically set Container ID based on Matter
   - [ ] Option C: Store Container ID in Dataverse and use lookup

**5. End-to-End Testing**
   - [ ] Upload single file
   - [ ] Upload multiple files
   - [ ] Verify Document records created in Dataverse
   - [ ] Verify files uploaded to correct SPE container
   - [ ] Test error handling

**6. Documentation**
   - [ ] Update deployment guide
   - [ ] Document Container ID vs Drive ID usage
   - [ ] Add troubleshooting section

## 📊 Technical Summary

### Current PCF Configuration (v2.0.6)

**Endpoint Being Called:**
```typescript
PUT https://spe-api-dev-67e2xz.azurewebsites.net/api/drives/{driveId}/upload?fileName={fileName}
Authorization: Bearer {MSAL-token}
Body: {file-binary}
```

**Form Fields Required:**
- `sprk_graphdriveid` (text field) - Drive ID for testing

**What Happens:**
1. User selects file(s) in Quick Create form
2. PCF gets MSAL token via Sprint 8 auth setup
3. PCF calls BFF API endpoint with Drive ID + file
4. BFF API uses Managed Identity to upload to SPE
5. BFF API returns file metadata
6. PCF creates Document record in Dataverse

---

## 🔧 Environment Status

### Deployed Components
- **PCF Control:** UniversalQuickCreateV2 v2.0.6
- **Solution:** UniversalQuickCreateSolution (Unmanaged)
- **Environment:** SPAARKE DEV 1 (https://spaarkedev1.crm.dynamics.com/)
- **BFF API:** https://spe-api-dev-67e2xz.azurewebsites.net (No changes made)

### Not Modified
- ✅ Spe.Bff.Api - No changes (as requested)
- ✅ Dataverse entities - No schema changes
- ✅ Existing Sprint 8 MSAL setup - Reused successfully

## 💡 Key Decisions Needed Tomorrow

1. **MI vs OBO Authentication**
   - Test with MI first to verify basic functionality?
   - Or go straight to OBO for production approach?

2. **Container ID Strategy**
   - How to get Container ID for testing?
   - Long-term: How should Container ID be determined in Quick Create?

3. **Field Configuration**
   - Keep using `sprk_graphdriveid` text field for Drive ID?
   - Or switch to `sprk_containerid` lookup for Container ID?

---

## 📝 Questions to Answer Tomorrow

1. Does the MI endpoint work for basic upload testing?
2. What Container ID should we use for testing?
3. Should we use OBO container endpoint instead?
4. How to programmatically determine Container ID from Matter/Case?

## 🎬 How to Resume Tomorrow

1. **Review this status document**
2. **Decide on MI vs OBO approach** (see Key Decisions above)
3. **Test current deployment** with Drive ID
4. **Based on results**, either:
   - Continue with MI endpoint, or
   - Switch to OBO container endpoint
5. **Complete end-to-end testing**
6. **Document final solution**

---

## 📌 Important Reminders

- **DO NOT modify Spe.Bff.Api** - all needed endpoints exist
- **PCF only calls BFF API** - never calls SPE directly
- **MSAL authentication from Sprint 8 works** - reuse it
- **Container ID ≠ Drive ID** - these are different things
- **OBO = user permissions, MI = service account** - choose wisely

**Session End Time:** ~12:20 AM
**Next Session:** Resume with authentication approach decision
