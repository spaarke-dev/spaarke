# OBO 403 Forbidden - Resolution Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-09
**Issue:** HTTP 403 when uploading files via OBO endpoint
**Status:** üî¥ **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED** - Ready for resolution

---

## TL;DR

**Problem:** BFF API returns 403 Forbidden when uploading files to SharePoint Embedded

**Root Cause:** BFF API (`1e40baad-e065-4aea-a8d4-4b7ab273458c`) is not registered with the SPE container type (`8a6ce34c-6055-4681-8f87-2f4f9f921c06`)

**Solution:** Register BFF API with container type and grant `WriteContent` delegated permission

**Key Insight:** Token B correctly has BFF API's `appid` (this is how OBO works). SPE validates this `appid` and requires explicit registration.

---

## What We Discovered

### The OAuth2 OBO Flow is Working Correctly ‚úÖ

```
PCF Control ‚Üí Token A ‚Üí BFF API ‚Üí OBO Exchange ‚Üí Token B ‚Üí Microsoft Graph ‚Üí SPE
```

**Token A (from PCF):**
- ‚úÖ `aud`: `api://1e40baad-e065-4aea-a8d4-4b7ab273458c` (BFF API)
- ‚úÖ `appid`: `170c98e1-d486-4355-bcbe-170454e0207c` (PCF app)
- ‚úÖ User identity: `ralph.schroeder@spaarke.com`

**Token B (from OBO):**
- ‚úÖ `aud`: `https://graph.microsoft.com`
- ‚úÖ **`appid`: `1e40baad-e065-4aea-a8d4-4b7ab273458c` (BFF API)** ‚Üê This is CORRECT
- ‚úÖ User identity: `ralph.schroeder@spaarke.com` (preserved)
- ‚úÖ Scopes: `FileStorageContainer.Selected`, `Sites.FullControl.All`, etc.
- ‚úÖ `idtyp`: `user` (delegated)

### Why Token B Has BFF API's appid

This is **expected and correct** OAuth2 OBO behavior:

> In OBO flow, Token B identifies the **middle-tier service** (BFF API) as the application making the downstream call, while preserving the **user's identity** from Token A.

From Microsoft docs:
> "The middle-tier service authenticates to the Microsoft identity platform and requests a token to access the downstream API."

The middle-tier's credentials authenticate the OBO request, so its `appid` appears in Token B.

### Why SPE Returns 403

SharePoint Embedded has **application-level permissions** separate from user permissions:

1. ‚úÖ **User check:** Is `ralph.schroeder@spaarke.com` authorized? ‚Üí YES (owner)
2. ‚ùå **Application check:** Is BFF API (`1e40baad-e065-4aea-a8d4-4b7ab273458c`) registered with container type? ‚Üí **NO**
3. **Result:** 403 Forbidden (application lacks container type permissions)

From SPE docs:
> "Applications need container type application permissions to access containers of that container type, **even in delegated scenarios**."

---

## What You Were Right About

Your intuition was correct:

> "The BFF API is acting somewhat as an anonymous requester‚Äîit's the confidential requesting app that is making the request, and this entire process is validating authority."

**Exactly right!** The BFF API IS the requesting application (from SPE's perspective), and SPE validates that this application has been granted permissions.

You also correctly identified:

> "I have not seen in any documentation that the app needs to register with a container."

The docs are not explicit about this for **middle-tier APIs in OBO scenarios**. The registration requirement is primarily documented for **direct client access**. However, SPE validates the `appid` claim regardless of whether it's direct access or OBO.

---

## The Solution

### Quick Version

Execute this API call (as owning application):

```http
PUT https://[tenant].sharepoint.com/_api/v2.1/storageContainerTypes/8a6ce34c-6055-4681-8f87-2f4f9f921c06/applicationPermissions
Authorization: Bearer [token-with-Container.Selected]
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "value": [
    {
      "appId": "1e40baad-e065-4aea-a8d4-4b7ab273458c",
      "delegated": ["WriteContent"],
      "appOnly": []
    }
  ]
}
```

### What This Does

Grants the BFF API application:
- **Delegated permission:** `WriteContent`
- **Meaning:** Can create/modify files when acting on behalf of an authorized user
- **Effect:** SPE will allow Token B (with BFF API's `appid`) to upload files as long as user has permissions

### Why This Fixes the Problem

**Before registration:**
```
SPE receives Token B ‚Üí Checks appid (BFF API) ‚Üí Not registered ‚Üí 403 Forbidden
```

**After registration:**
```
SPE receives Token B ‚Üí Checks appid (BFF API) ‚Üí Registered with WriteContent ‚Üí Checks user ‚Üí User is owner ‚Üí ‚úÖ Allow upload
```

## Implementation Steps

1. **Gather prerequisites** (need from you):
   - Tenant SharePoint URL
   - Owning application credentials
   - Access to container type registration API

2. **Execute registration:**
   - Authenticate as owning application
   - Call registration API (see [CONTAINER-TYPE-REGISTRATION-GUIDE.md](./CONTAINER-TYPE-REGISTRATION-GUIDE.md))
   - Verify registration successful

3. **Test:**
   - No code changes needed!
   - OBO upload should work immediately
   - Test with PCF control

4. **Document:**
   - Add to deployment guide
   - Update environment setup checklist

---

## What Changed Your Mind

Initially, you suspected the BFF API shouldn't need registration because:
> "The BFF API is acting... as the confidential requesting app"

You were right about the architecture, but SPE's permission model requires **both**:
- ‚úÖ User permissions (owner/contributor on specific container)
- ‚úÖ Application permissions (registered with container type)

This is **"defense in depth"** security:
1. User must be authorized ‚Üí Prevents unauthorized user access
2. Application must be registered ‚Üí Prevents rogue applications from accessing containers

Even though the BFF API is acting on behalf of an authorized user, SPE still validates the application making the call.

---

## Why This Was Hard to Diagnose

1. **OBO flow is complex** - Multiple tokens, multiple applications
2. **Token B looked "wrong"** - Having BFF API's `appid` seemed like a problem
3. **Documentation gap** - SPE docs don't explicitly cover middle-tier OBO scenarios
4. **Error message is generic** - Graph returns "Access denied" without specifics

The breakthrough came from:
1. ‚úÖ Capturing and analyzing Token B
2. ‚úÖ Understanding OBO flow specification (Token B appid is correct)
3. ‚úÖ Finding SPE documentation on application-level permissions
4. ‚úÖ Connecting the dots: SPE checks `appid` claim for registration

---

## Validation That We're Right

### Evidence Supporting This Diagnosis

1. **OBO flow working perfectly:**
   - Token exchange succeeds
   - Token B has all required scopes
   - User identity preserved

2. **User permissions verified:**
   - `ralph.schroeder@spaarke.com` is owner on container
   - Confirmed via GET `/containers/{id}/permissions`

3. **Postman works with PCF app:**
   - Postman uses PCF app credentials directly
   - PCF app IS registered with container type (user granted permissions)
   - Same container, same user, different app ‚Üí Works!

4. **Error pattern matches documentation:**
   - Graph returns 403 "Access denied"
   - No specific error code
   - Matches SPE "application lacks permissions" pattern

5. **Microsoft documentation confirms:**
   - "Applications need container type application permissions"
   - "Even in delegated scenarios"
   - Registration API exists specifically for this purpose

### What We Ruled Out

- ‚ùå OBO token exchange failing ‚Üí Fixed with client secret
- ‚ùå Missing Graph scopes ‚Üí Token B has all required scopes
- ‚ùå User permissions issue ‚Üí User is owner
- ‚ùå Token format issue ‚Üí Token B is correctly formatted delegated token
- ‚ùå Graph API endpoint issue ‚Üí Same endpoint works in Postman
- ‚ùå Container ID issue ‚Üí Same container works in Postman

**Only remaining factor:** Different `appid` in token (BFF API vs PCF app)

---

## Confidence Level

**95% confident** this is the root cause:

**Why confident:**
1. All other factors verified working
2. Matches documented SPE permission model
3. Explains why Postman works (different appid)
4. Solution is documented by Microsoft
5. Error pattern matches

**5% uncertainty:**
- Haven't executed the fix yet
- Possible there's an additional undocumented requirement

**Risk mitigation:**
- Registration is reversible (can be removed if wrong)
- Won't affect other functionality
- Can test immediately after registration

---

## Expected Outcome

### After Registration

**OBO upload request:**
```http
PUT /api/obo/containers/{id}/files/test.txt
Authorization: Bearer [Token A]
```

**Expected response:**
```json
{
  "id": "01...",
  "name": "test.txt",
  "size": 123,
  "webUrl": "https://...",
  "createdDateTime": "2025-10-09T..."
}
```

**Application Insights logs:**
```
[INFO] OBO token exchange successful
[INFO] OBO token scopes: FileStorageContainer.Selected Sites.FullControl.All ...
[INFO] OBO upload successful - DriveItemId: {id}
```

**PCF control:**
- File picker works
- Upload succeeds
- Success message displayed
- Files appear in container

## Alternative Approaches (If Registration Fails)

If container type registration is not feasible for some reason:

### Option A: Direct Graph Call from PCF
- Remove BFF API from flow
- PCF calls Graph API directly
- **Pros:** PCF app already registered
- **Cons:** Lose BFF benefits (retry, monitoring, caching)

### Option B: App-Only with User Context Header
- BFF uses Managed Identity (app-only)
- Add custom header to track user
- **Pros:** No container type registration needed
- **Cons:** Lose user-level permissions enforcement

### Option C: Hybrid Approach
- Use OBO for user context verification
- Use Managed Identity for actual Graph call
- **Pros:** Both user validation and app permissions
- **Cons:** More complex, two tokens

**Recommendation:** Proceed with container type registration. It's the "right" solution architecturally.

## Next Actions for You

### Immediate (to proceed with fix):

1. **Find tenant SharePoint URL:**
   ```powershell
   Connect-AzAccount -TenantId a221a95e-6abc-4434-aecc-e48338a1b2f2
   # Look for tenant domain in output
   ```

2. **Identify owning application:**
   ```powershell
   # Use PnP PowerShell or contact SharePoint admin
   Get-PnPContainerType | Where-Object {$_.ContainerTypeId -eq "8a6ce34c-6055-4681-8f87-2f4f9f921c06"}
   ```

3. **Obtain owning app credentials:**
   - Client ID
   - Client Secret or Certificate
   - Must have `Container.Selected` permission

4. **Execute registration:**
   - Follow [CONTAINER-TYPE-REGISTRATION-GUIDE.md](./CONTAINER-TYPE-REGISTRATION-GUIDE.md)
   - Test immediately after

### After successful registration:

1. **Test OBO endpoint** - Should work immediately
2. **Test PCF control** - File upload should work
3. **Update deployment docs** - Add registration to setup guide
4. **Plan for other environments** - Test, Staging, Production

## Questions?

**Q: Why doesn't PCF app need registration?**
A: PCF app IS registered (that's what happens when user grants permissions via consent screen). But PCF app never calls Graph directly, so its registration isn't checked.

**Q: Why does Postman work?**
A: Postman uses PCF app credentials and calls Graph directly. Token has PCF app's `appid`, which IS registered.

**Q: Will this affect existing functionality?**
A: No. Only affects OBO upload endpoint. Admin/management endpoints use Managed Identity (different auth path).

**Q: Do we need to modify code?**
A: No code changes needed! Registration is purely configuration.

**Q: What if registration doesn't work?**
A: We can try alternative approaches (see above), but registration should work based on Microsoft docs.

**Status:** Awaiting prerequisites to execute registration.

**Confidence:** 95% this will resolve the issue.

**Next Step:** Gather tenant SharePoint URL and owning application credentials.
