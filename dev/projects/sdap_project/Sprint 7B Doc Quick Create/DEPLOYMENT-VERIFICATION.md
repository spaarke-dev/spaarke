## Verification Steps for User

### Step 1: Clear Everything
**CRITICAL - Do this first:**

1. **Close ALL Power Apps browser tabs**
2. **Clear browser cache:**
   - Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`
   - Select "All time"
   - Check: ✅ Cookies and site data, ✅ Cached images and files
   - Click "Clear data"
3. **Close browser completely**
4. **Reopen browser**

### Step 2: Verify Solution in Dataverse

1. Go to https://make.powerapps.com
2. Select **Spaarke Dev 1** environment
3. Go to **Solutions**
4. Find **UniversalQuickCreateSolution**
5. Click on it
6. Go to **Custom controls**
7. Click on `sprk_Spaarke.Controls.UniversalQuickCreate`

**What you should see:**
- Display Name: **Universal Quick Create**
- Description: **Multi-file upload control for Quick Create forms**
- Resources tab should show files

### Step 3: Check Web Resource Timestamp

1. In Power Apps maker portal
2. Go to **More** → **Advanced** → **Resources** → **Web Resources**
3. Search for "Universal" or "Spaarke.Controls"
4. Check the **Modified On** date

**Expected:** Should show today's date (2025-10-07) and recent time

**If it shows "2 hours ago":** The old cached version is still being used. Try:
- Go back to Solutions
- Click **UniversalQuickCreateSolution**
- Click **...** → **Publish all customizations**
- Wait for completion
- Check web resource timestamp again

### Step 4: Configure Form (Fresh Start)

1. Go to **Tables** → **Document** (sprk_document)
2. Go to **Forms** tab
3. Open **Quick Create: Document** form
4. **Remove the old component if it's still there:**
   - Click on the field that has the component
   - Go to Components panel
   - Remove "Universal Quick Create" if present
   - Click the field → select "Text Box" control
   - Save form
5. **Add component fresh:**
   - Click on **Document Name** field (or create new Single Line Text field)
   - Click **+ Component**
   - Select **"Universal Quick Create"** (should show proper name now, not the key)
   - Configure:
     - Bound Field: Document Name (Text)
     - Enable File Upload: True
     - Allow Multiple Files: True
     - SDAP API Base URL: `https://localhost:7299/api`
     - **UNCHECK** all "Bind to table column" checkboxes
   - Click **Done**
6. **Set component visibility:**
   - With field selected, go to Components tab
   - Make sure "Universal Quick Create" is selected for Web, Mobile, Tablet
7. **Save** the form
8. **Publish** the form

### Step 5: Test the Control

**Option A: Test in Form Designer (Preview)**

Some designers have a preview mode - if available, use it to see the control.

**Option B: Test in Actual Form**

1. Go to **Apps** in Power Apps
2. Open an app that uses the Document entity
3. Find a subgrid or list of Documents
4. Click "+ New" or "+ Quick Create"
5. The Quick Create form should open

**What You SHOULD See (v1.0.6):**

At the top of the field area, a **blue banner**:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Universal Quick Create v1.0.6 - Control Loaded ✓│  ← BLUE BACKGROUND, WHITE TEXT
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Below that, a **blue "Add File" button**:
```
┌──────────────┐
│ ⬆ Add File   │  ← BLUE BUTTON WITH UPLOAD ICON
└──────────────┘
```

**If you see the blue banner:**
- ✅ Control is version 1.0.6
- ✅ Control is loading correctly
- ✅ The init() method ran
- ✅ The container is attached to DOM

**If the button doesn't render but banner shows:**
- Issue is with React/Fluent UI rendering
- Open browser console (F12) and share errors

**If you see NOTHING at all:**
- Control isn't being used or form didn't save correctly
- Check form configuration again
- Verify component is selected in Components tab

---

## What the Control Should Do

Once working, here's the expected behavior:

1. **Initial State:**
   - Blue version badge
   - "Add File" button

2. **Click "Add File":**
   - File picker dialog opens
   - Select one or multiple files
   - Files appear in a list below the button

3. **File List:**
   - Shows file name, size
   - Shows document icon
   - Has X button to remove each file
   - Button changes to "Add More Files"

4. **On Form Save:**
   - Custom "Save and Create X Documents" button appears in footer
   - Click to upload files to SharePoint Embedded
   - Creates Document records in Dataverse

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still shows old version or nothing

**Solution:**
1. Delete browser cache again
2. Try **Incognito/Private** browser window
3. Check if any service worker is caching (Dev Tools → Application → Service Workers → Unregister)

### Issue: Component name still shows as key

**Solution:**
1. The display name is embedded in the control manifest
2. If still showing key, the old version is cached
3. Go to Solutions → UniversalQuickCreateSolution → Publish all customizations
4. Wait 2 minutes
5. Hard refresh form designer (Ctrl+F5)

### Issue: Form won't save with component

**Solution:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Make sure field is NOT secured (no key icon)
3. Try different field (create new Single Line Text field)

### Issue: Blue banner shows but no button

**Solution:**
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Look for errors mentioning:
   - React
   - FluentUI
   - Component rendering
3. Share screenshot of console errors

---

## Console Logging

The control now logs extensively. In browser console (F12 → Console), filter by "UniversalQuickCreate" to see:

- ✅ "Constructor called"
- ✅ "Initializing PCF control"
- ✅ "renderReactComponent called"
- ✅ "Rendering FileUploadField component"

If you don't see these logs, the control isn't being loaded at all.

---

## Files to Check in Dataverse

**Custom Control:**
- Name: `sprk_Spaarke.Controls.UniversalQuickCreate`
- Location: Solutions → UniversalQuickCreateSolution → Custom controls

**Web Resources (embedded in control, may not appear separately):**
- `bundle.js` (570 KB)
- `css/UniversalQuickCreate.css`

**Note:** PCF controls bundle their resources, so you might NOT see separate web resources. This is normal!

---

## Next Steps

1. **Follow verification steps above**
2. **Share what you see:**
   - Screenshot of form with control (or lack thereof)
   - Browser console output
   - Web resource timestamp

3. **If blue banner appears:** We're very close! React rendering is the last piece.
4. **If nothing appears:** We need to check form configuration and browser cache.

## Support Information

**Deployment confirmed:**
- Package version: 1.0.6 ✅
- Bundle contains version badge code ✅
- Imported and published ✅
- No import errors ✅

**Control should display:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Universal Quick Create v1.0.6 - Control Loaded ✓│
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌──────────────┐
│ ⬆ Add File   │
└──────────────┘
```

The blue banner is the most important indicator. If it appears, the fundamental PCF framework is working correctly.
