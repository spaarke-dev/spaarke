### **PHASE 1: Foundation Setup (Days 1-5)**

**CURRENT STATUS:** üü° 75% Complete - Entity creation pending

**COMPLETED WORK:**
- ‚úÖ Task 1.2: BFF API Service Extensions (DataverseService implementation)
- ‚úÖ Task 1.3: Basic API infrastructure setup
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Task 1.1: Dataverse Entity Creation (HIGH PRIORITY - BLOCKS TESTING)

**ARCHITECTURAL DECISION RECORD:**
Based on senior developer analysis, we've implemented managed identity authentication over connection strings for enhanced security. The service layer uses the repository pattern with proper dependency injection, following SOLID principles.

#### **Task 1.1: Dataverse Entity Creation**

**STATUS: ‚ö†Ô∏è PENDING - HIGH PRIORITY**

**DEPENDENCIES:** Must be completed before API endpoints can be fully tested

**AI PROMPT:**
```
Create Dataverse entity schemas for document management with the following requirements:

CONTEXT:
- Building file management system with SharePoint Embedded integration
- Need 1:1 relationship between Document records and SPE files
- Must support future one-file-multiple-documents scenario
- Document access control determines file access permissions

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Create sprk_document entity with these fields:
   - sprk_name (String, 255, required): Document display name
   - sprk_containerid (Lookup to sprk_container, required): Container reference
   - sprk_hasfile (Boolean, default false): Whether document has associated file
   - sprk_filename (String, 255): Name of file in SPE
   - sprk_filesize (BigInt): File size in bytes
   - sprk_mimetype (String, 100): File MIME type
   - sprk_graphitemid (String, 100): SPE item identifier
   - sprk_graphdriveid (String, 100): SPE drive identifier
   - sprk_status (OptionSet): Draft=1, Active=2, Processing=3, Error=4

2. Update sprk_container entity to include:
   - sprk_documentcount (Integer, default 0): Count of associated documents

PATTERNS TO FOLLOW:
- Use "sprk_" prefix for all custom fields
- Include proper descriptions for each field
- Set appropriate field lengths based on SharePoint Embedded limits
- Configure proper relationships and cascade behaviors

DELIVERABLES:
- Entity schema JSON files
- Relationship configuration
- Security role definitions
- Form and view configurations

TEST CRITERIA:
- Entities can be created through Power Platform admin center
- Relationships work correctly in model-driven apps
- Security roles properly restrict field access
- Form layouts are user-friendly
```

**KNOWLEDGE REFERENCES:**
- Existing `ProjectionPlugin.cs` for entity naming patterns
- Dataverse configuration files in project
- Current entity relationship patterns

**VALIDATION STEPS:**
1. Create test Document record through admin center
2. Verify Container lookup works correctly
3. Test field validation rules
4. Confirm security role access
5. Validate entity relationship cascading behaviors
6. Test form performance with expected data volumes
7. Verify field-level security works as designed

**CONCLUSION AND GO TO NEXT STEP:**
The Dataverse entity schema is the foundation for the entire document management system. Until these entities are properly created and configured, the DataverseService (already implemented) cannot be fully tested against real Dataverse entities.

This task has **HIGH PRIORITY** and should be completed immediately. Once the entities are created, you can:
1. Test the existing DataverseService implementation against real entities
2. Validate the field mappings in the service layer
3. Proceed with confidence to implement the Document CRUD API endpoints

The entity creation should be done in the Power Platform admin center or through the maker portal. Ensure you follow the exact field specifications in the AI prompt to match the service implementation.

The next logical step after completing these endpoints would be to move to Phase 2: Service Bus Integration, specifically implementing the thin plugin architecture.

---

### **PHASE 2: Service Bus Integration (Days 6-10)**

#### **Task 2.1: Thin Plugin Implementation**

**AI PROMPT:**
```
Create a thin Dataverse plugin that follows ADR-002 principles for minimal plugin logic:

CONTEXT:
- Need to capture Document entity events (Create, Update, Delete) in Dataverse
- Plugin should ONLY queue events to Service Bus, no business logic
- Must be ultra-fast (target < 200ms execution) and reliable
- Should not fail main Dataverse operation if queuing fails
- Follows existing plugin patterns in the solution

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Create DocumentEventPlugin that:
   - Registers on sprk_document entity for Create, Update, Delete
   - Extracts minimal event data from plugin context
   - Queues structured event message to Service Bus
   - Handles failures gracefully without breaking Dataverse operation
   - Includes comprehensive logging for debugging

2. Event message structure:
   ```csharp
   public class DocumentEvent
   {
       public string EventId { get; set; }
       public string DocumentId { get; set; }
       public string Operation { get; set; } // Create, Update, Delete
       public string UserId { get; set; }
       public string OrganizationId { get; set; }
       public string CorrelationId { get; set; }
       public DateTime Timestamp { get; set; }
       public Dictionary<string, object> EntityData { get; set; }
   }
   ```

3. Plugin configuration:
   - Use secure configuration for Service Bus connection string
   - Support configuration of queue/topic names
   - Include retry logic for Service Bus operations
   - Proper error handling and logging

PATTERNS TO FOLLOW:
- Reference existing ProjectionPlugin.cs for plugin structure
- Use ITracingService for logging (not ILogger in plugin context)
- Follow plugin registration patterns
- Keep execution time minimal - no complex operations
- Use synchronous Service Bus operations (required in plugin context)

EXISTING PATTERNS TO REFERENCE:
- power-platform/plugins/Spaarke.Plugins/ProjectionPlugin.cs
- Service Bus patterns from existing background job system

DELIVERABLES:
- DocumentEventPlugin.cs with event queuing logic

- Documentation for plugin deployment and configuration

TEST CRITERIA:
- Plugin executes in < 200ms for all operations
- Events are properly queued to Service Bus
- Plugin failures don't break Dataverse operations
- All entity events (Create, Update, Delete) are captured
- Logging provides sufficient debugging information
```

**KNOWLEDGE REFERENCES:**
- `power-platform/plugins/Spaarke.Plugins/ProjectionPlugin.cs`
- `src/api/Spe.Bff.Api/Services/Jobs/JobContract.cs`
- Service Bus integration patterns in the solution

**VALIDATION STEPS:**
1. Plugin registers correctly in test environment
2. Events appear in Service Bus when documents are modified
3. Plugin performance meets < 200ms target
4. Error scenarios don't break Dataverse operations
5. Event payload contains all required data

**CONCLUSION AND GO TO NEXT STEP:**
The thin plugin implementation is critical for maintaining the async-first architecture. Once this plugin is working correctly, you'll have established the event-driven foundation that enables all complex business logic to run outside of Dataverse transaction context.

After completing this task, immediately proceed to Task 2.2: Background Service Implementation to handle the events queued by this plugin. The plugin and background service work as a pair - neither is complete without the other.

---

#### **Task 2.2: Background Service Implementation**

**AI PROMPT:**
```
Create background services to process document events from Service Bus:

TEST CRITERIA:
- Background service processes events correctly
- All document operations trigger appropriate actions
- Retry logic handles transient failures
- Dead letter handling works for permanent failures
- Performance meets processing time requirements
- Health checks report correct service status
```

**KNOWLEDGE REFERENCES:**
- Existing background service patterns in the solution
- `src/api/Spe.Bff.Api/Services/Jobs/` folder
- Service Bus configuration in Program.cs
- Health check patterns

**VALIDATION STEPS:**
1. Service starts and connects to Service Bus correctly
2. Document events are processed without errors
3. SPE integration works for file operations
4. Dataverse updates succeed
5. Error scenarios handled gracefully

**CONCLUSION AND GO TO NEXT STEP:**
Completing the background service implementation establishes the complete async processing pipeline. At this point, you'll have a fully functional backend that can handle document operations asynchronously with proper error handling and retry logic.

With the backend architecture complete, the next logical phase is Power Platform Integration (Phase 3). Begin with Task 3.1: Model-Driven App Configuration to create the user interface that will consume these backend services.

## Security and Compliance Framework

### **Enterprise Security Strategy**

**SENIOR DEVELOPER SECURITY PRINCIPLES:**
Security must be designed into every layer of the application:
- **Zero Trust Architecture**: Never trust, always verify every request
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers with no single point of failure
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimum necessary permissions for each component
- **Security by Design**: Security controls integrated from development to deployment
- **Continuous Security**: Automated security testing and vulnerability management

**AI PROMPT:**
```
Implement comprehensive security and compliance framework:

AUTHENTICATION AND AUTHORIZATION:
