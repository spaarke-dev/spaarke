# NPM Package Decision - Reassessment
**Date:** October 4, 2025
**Context:** User will build OTHER PCF controls (not just Universal Grid variations)
**Status:** üîÑ DECISION REQUIRES RECONSIDERATION

---

## Critical Clarification

**User Statement:**
> "But to be clear--we will build other PCF controls in our environment (not Universal Grid but others)"

**This changes the analysis!**

## Key Questions to Determine NPM Package Need

### Question 1: Will Other PCF Controls Need SDAP Integration?

**Scenarios:**

**Scenario A: Other Controls DON'T Need SDAP**
```
Control #1: Universal Dataset Grid
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Purpose: Document/file management
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Needs: SDAP integration ‚úÖ

Control #2: Custom Activity Timeline
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Purpose: Show activity history
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Needs: SDAP integration? ‚ùå No

Control #3: Sales Dashboard Widget
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Purpose: Show metrics/charts
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Needs: SDAP integration? ‚ùå No

Control #4: Address Map Viewer
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Purpose: Show locations on map
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Needs: SDAP integration? ‚ùå No
```

**Conclusion:** Only Universal Grid needs SDAP ‚Üí **No NPM package needed** ‚úÖ

---

**Scenario B: Other Controls DO Need SDAP**
```
Control #1: Universal Dataset Grid
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Purpose: Document/file management (grid view)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Needs: SDAP integration ‚úÖ

Control #2: Document Preview Widget
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Purpose: Single document with preview
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Needs: SDAP integration ‚úÖ (download file for preview)

Control #3: Contract Signature Control
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Purpose: Contract workflow with e-signature
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Needs: SDAP integration ‚úÖ (download contract PDF)

Control #4: Invoice Upload Widget
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Purpose: Upload invoices with OCR
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Needs: SDAP integration ‚úÖ (upload file)
```

**Conclusion:** Multiple controls need SDAP ‚Üí **NPM package IS valuable** ‚úÖ

---

### Question 2: What Other PCF Controls Are Planned?

**Please clarify:**

**A. Planned PCF Controls in Next 6-12 Months**
- What controls are on your roadmap?
- What is their primary purpose?
- Will they interact with documents/files?

**Examples to help you think through this:**

**Entity-Specific Controls:**
- Timeline/activity controls (no SDAP needed)
- Dashboard/reporting controls (no SDAP needed)
- Custom form controls (might need SDAP)
- Data visualization controls (no SDAP needed)

**Document/File-Related Controls:**
- Document preview/viewer (‚úÖ NEEDS SDAP)
- File upload widgets (‚úÖ NEEDS SDAP)
- Document comparison (‚úÖ NEEDS SDAP)
- Signature/approval controls (‚úÖ NEEDS SDAP)

**Workflow/Process Controls:**
- Approval workflows (might need SDAP if documents involved)
- Custom wizards (might need SDAP if file upload)
- Data entry forms (probably doesn't need SDAP)

---

### Question 3: Document/File Management in Other Scenarios?

**Will any other controls need to:**
- ‚úÖ Upload files to SharePoint Embedded?
- ‚úÖ Download files from SharePoint Embedded?
- ‚úÖ Delete files from SharePoint Embedded?
- ‚úÖ List files in a container?

**If YES to any:** NPM package is valuable
**If NO to all:** NPM package not needed

---

## Decision Matrix

### Path A: Other Controls DON'T Need SDAP

**Characteristics:**
- Other PCF controls are for different purposes (dashboards, timelines, maps, etc.)
- Only Universal Dataset Grid manages documents/files
- No other controls interact with SharePoint Embedded

**Recommendation:** ‚úÖ **Option 2 (Direct PCF Integration)**
- Build SDAP client directly in Universal Dataset Grid
- No NPM package
- Other controls don't use it anyway

**Effort:** Sprint 6 as planned (90 hours with Fluent UI + chunked upload)

---

### Path B: Other Controls DO Need SDAP

**Characteristics:**
- 2+ controls need document/file operations
- Multiple controls will upload/download files
- Different controls for different document workflows

**Recommendation:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **Reconsider Option 3 (NPM Package)**

**Two Sub-Options:**

**B1: Build NPM Package Now (Sprint 6)**
```
Pros:
‚úÖ Do it right from the start
‚úÖ Other controls can use immediately
‚úÖ No future migration needed
‚úÖ Consistent SDAP integration across all controls

Cons:
‚ö†Ô∏è +8 hours initial setup
‚ö†Ô∏è Sprint 6 extended (90 ‚Üí 98 hours)

Effort: 98 hours total
Timeline: 2.5 weeks
```

**B2: Build with Direct PCF Now, Migrate Later**
```
Pros:
‚úÖ Faster Sprint 6 delivery
‚úÖ Learn requirements before abstracting

Cons:
‚ö†Ô∏è Migration effort later (6 hours)
‚ö†Ô∏è Duplicate code temporarily
‚ö†Ô∏è Two deployment cycles

Effort: 90 hours (Sprint 6) + 6 hours (migration)
Timeline: 2.25 weeks + future migration
```

## Recommended Analysis Process

### Step 1: List All Planned PCF Controls

**Please provide:**

| Control Name | Primary Purpose | Needs Files? | Needs SDAP? |
|--------------|-----------------|--------------|-------------|
| Universal Dataset Grid | Document management grid | Yes | Yes |
| [Your Control #2] | [Purpose?] | [Yes/No?] | [Yes/No?] |
| [Your Control #3] | [Purpose?] | [Yes/No?] | [Yes/No?] |
| [Your Control #4] | [Purpose?] | [Yes/No?] | [Yes/No?] |

**Example filled in:**

| Control Name | Primary Purpose | Needs Files? | Needs SDAP? |
|--------------|-----------------|--------------|-------------|
| Universal Dataset Grid | Document management grid | Yes | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Sales Activity Timeline | Show activity history | No | ‚ùå No |
| Revenue Dashboard | Show charts/metrics | No | ‚ùå No |
| Contract Preview Widget | View contract with preview | Yes | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Invoice Upload Form | Upload invoices for processing | Yes | ‚úÖ Yes |

**Result:** 3 out of 5 controls need SDAP ‚Üí **NPM package recommended** ‚úÖ

---

### Step 2: Count SDAP-Needing Controls

**If 0-1 controls need SDAP:**
‚Üí Use Option 2 (Direct PCF)

**If 2+ controls need SDAP:**
‚Üí Use Option 3 (NPM Package)

---

## What We Need from You

### Critical Information:

**Question 1:** What other PCF controls are you planning to build?
- List control names
- Brief description of each

**Question 2:** Will any of these controls need to:
- Upload files to SharePoint Embedded?
- Download files from SharePoint Embedded?
- Delete/manage files?

**Question 3:** Timeline for these controls?
- Sprint 7?
- Sprint 8?
- Next quarter?
- Next year?

---

## Likely Scenarios (Our Guess)

### Scenario 1: Document-Focused Environment

**If your organization is heavily document-focused:**

```
Likely Controls:
‚úÖ Universal Dataset Grid (Sprint 6)
‚úÖ Contract Preview Widget (Sprint 7)
‚úÖ Document Comparison Tool (Sprint 8)
‚úÖ Invoice Upload Widget (Sprint 9)
‚úÖ Approval Workflow Control (Sprint 10)

SDAP Usage: 5 out of 5 controls
```

**Recommendation:** ‚úÖ **Build NPM package now (Option 3)**
- Worth 8-hour upfront investment
- Saves 300 lines √ó 4 = 1,200 lines duplication
- Consistent implementation
- Single source of truth

**Updated Sprint 6:** 98 hours (add 8 hours for NPM package setup)

---

### Scenario 2: Mixed Environment

**If your organization has diverse needs:**

```
Likely Controls:
‚úÖ Universal Dataset Grid (Sprint 6) - SDAP
‚ùå Sales Pipeline Dashboard (Sprint 7) - No SDAP
‚ùå Customer Timeline Widget (Sprint 8) - No SDAP
‚úÖ Document Preview Widget (Sprint 9) - SDAP
‚ùå Territory Map Viewer (Sprint 10) - No SDAP

SDAP Usage: 2 out of 5 controls
```

**Recommendation:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **Could go either way**

**Option A:** Build NPM package now (8 hours upfront)
- Pro: Ready for Control #2 in Sprint 9
- Con: 8-hour investment for future use

**Option B:** Direct PCF now, migrate before Sprint 9 (6 hours later)
- Pro: Faster Sprint 6
- Con: Migration effort later

**Lean toward:** Option A if Sprint 9 is within 3 months

---

### Scenario 3: Mostly Non-Document Controls

**If most controls are for other purposes:**

```
Likely Controls:
‚úÖ Universal Dataset Grid (Sprint 6) - SDAP
‚ùå KPI Dashboard (Sprint 7) - No SDAP
‚ùå Process Flow Diagram (Sprint 8) - No SDAP
‚ùå Data Import Wizard (Sprint 9) - No SDAP
‚ùå Custom Report Viewer (Sprint 10) - No SDAP

SDAP Usage: 1 out of 5 controls
```

**Recommendation:** ‚úÖ **Use Option 2 (Direct PCF)**
- Only one control needs SDAP
- No duplication
- NPM package unnecessary

**Sprint 6:** 90 hours (no NPM package)

---

## Updated Decision Framework

### Use NPM Package (Option 3) If:

**At least ONE of these is true:**

1. ‚úÖ Planning **2+ controls** that need SDAP integration
2. ‚úÖ Second SDAP control planned within **3 months**
3. ‚úÖ Building **document management suite** of controls
4. ‚úÖ Multiple teams will build controls needing SDAP
5. ‚úÖ Want to publish reusable component library

**Effort:** +8 hours to Sprint 6 (90 ‚Üí 98 hours)

---

### Use Direct PCF (Option 2) If:

**ALL of these are true:**

1. ‚úÖ Only **Universal Grid** needs SDAP (in next 3-6 months)
2. ‚úÖ Other controls are for different purposes (no file operations)
3. ‚úÖ Prefer faster Sprint 6 delivery
4. ‚úÖ Okay with 6-hour migration later if needed

**Effort:** Sprint 6 as planned (90 hours)

---

## Recommendation: Need Your Input

**We can't make this decision without knowing:**

1. What other PCF controls are you planning?
2. Will they need document/file operations?
3. When will you build them?

**Please provide:**
- List of planned PCF controls (even high-level)
- Rough timeline
- Whether they interact with files/documents

**Then we can make the right call:** Option 2 or Option 3

---

## Interim Recommendation (Conservative Approach)

**If you're unsure about future controls:**

### Use Option 3 (NPM Package) - "Future-Proof" Approach

**Rationale:**
- You confirmed building other PCF controls
- Document management is often needed across controls
- 8-hour investment is cheap insurance
- Better to have it and not need it than vice versa
- Easy to NOT use if other controls don't need SDAP

**Implementation:**
- Build `@spaarke/sdap-client` package in Sprint 6
- Universal Grid uses it
- Other controls can use it if needed
- If they don't need it, no harm done

**Downside:** 8 hours longer Sprint 6 (90 ‚Üí 98 hours)

**Upside:** Ready for any future SDAP-needing control

---

## What Do You Think?

**Please clarify:**

1. **What other PCF controls are on your roadmap?**
   - Names and purposes
   - Rough timeline

2. **Will any of them need file/document operations?**
   - Upload files
   - Download files
   - Manage documents

3. **Your preference:**
   - A) Build NPM package now (+8 hours, future-proof)
   - B) Direct PCF now, migrate later if needed (faster now, 6 hours later)

**Once we know this, we can finalize the approach!**
