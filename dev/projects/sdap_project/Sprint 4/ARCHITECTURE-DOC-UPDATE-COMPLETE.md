## Content Highlights

### 1. Clear Problem Statement

**Before (Old Doc):**
> "Task 4.4 appears to significantly expand OBO operations"

**After (New Doc):**
> Explains dual authentication problem with security examples, shows why OBO is required for user operations, demonstrates security breach scenarios

### 2. Architecture Diagrams

**Added:**
- High-level architecture diagram (with ASCII art)
- Request flow examples (App-Only vs OBO)
- Component interaction diagrams

**Example:**
```
API Layer
  ↓
SpeFileStore (Single Facade)
  ↓
Operation Classes (4 specialized modules)
  ↓
GraphClientFactory (MI + OBO)
  ↓
Microsoft Graph API / SharePoint Embedded
```

### 3. Code Patterns

**6 Patterns Documented:**
1. Facade Pattern (SpeFileStore)
2. Strategy Pattern (Dual Auth)
3. DTO Mapping Pattern (ADR-007 compliance)
4. Naming Convention (`*Async` vs `*AsUserAsync`)
5. Token Validation Pattern
6. Resilience Pattern (Centralized Polly)

Each pattern includes:
- Intent
- Implementation code
- Benefits
- Real examples

### 4. Developer Guidelines

**DO Section:**
- Use SpeFileStore for all Graph operations
- Use correct method for auth mode
- Always map Graph SDK types to DTOs
- Validate user tokens early
- Use structured logging
- Handle ServiceExceptions properly

**DON'T Section:**
- Don't create Graph clients directly
- Don't bypass SpeFileStore
- Don't mix auth modes
- Don't expose Graph SDK types
- Don't inject operation classes directly

### 5. Troubleshooting Guide

**5 Common Issues:**
1. "401 Unauthorized" on OBO endpoint
2. "403 Forbidden" on OBO operation
3. Graph SDK type leaked through API
4. OBO token exchange fails
5. Managed Identity not working locally

Each issue includes:
- Symptoms
- Possible causes
- Diagnostic commands
- Step-by-step fixes
