**Bundle Size**: 8.47 MiB (development)

---

## Summary

Successfully implemented file deletion functionality with user confirmation, allowing users to delete files from SharePoint Embedded via SDAP API while preserving Dataverse document records with cleared metadata.

---

## Deliverables

### 1. ConfirmDialog.tsx ✅

**Location**: `src/controls/UniversalDatasetGrid/UniversalDatasetGrid/components/ConfirmDialog.tsx`

**Features**:
- ✅ Reusable confirmation dialog component
- ✅ Fluent UI v9 Dialog components
- ✅ Customizable title, message, button labels
- ✅ Confirm and cancel callbacks
- ✅ Auto-close on backdrop click
- ✅ Fully typed with TypeScript

**Implementation**:
```typescript
export const ConfirmDialog: React.FC<ConfirmDialogProps> = ({
    open,
    title,
    message,
    confirmLabel = 'Confirm',
    cancelLabel = 'Cancel',
    onConfirm,
    onCancel
}) => { /* ... */ }
```

**Reusability**: Can be used for any confirmation scenario (not just file delete)

### 2. FileDeleteService.ts ✅

**Location**: `src/controls/UniversalDatasetGrid/UniversalDatasetGrid/services/FileDeleteService.ts`

**Features**:
- ✅ `deleteFile()` - Single file delete with Dataverse update
- ✅ `deleteMultipleFiles()` - Batch delete with progress tracking
- ✅ Two-phase delete (SPE first, then Dataverse)
- ✅ Partial failure detection and logging
- ✅ ServiceResult pattern for error handling
- ✅ Comprehensive logging

**Delete Flow**:
1. Delete file from SharePoint Embedded via `SdapApiClient.deleteFile({ driveId, itemId })`
2. Update Dataverse record via `context.webAPI.updateRecord()`:
   - `sprk_hasfile = false`
   - Clear all file metadata fields (graphitemid, filesize, etc.)
3. Return success/failure

**Key Design Decision**:
- **Records are NOT deleted**, only files
- Document metadata remains in Dataverse with `hasFile = false`
- This preserves document history and relationships

### 3. UniversalDatasetGridRoot.tsx Updates ✅

**Location**: `src/controls/UniversalDatasetGrid/UniversalDatasetGrid/components/UniversalDatasetGridRoot.tsx`

**Changes**:
- ✅ Added imports for ConfirmDialog, FileDeleteService
- ✅ Added state for delete confirmation dialog
- ✅ Implemented `handleDeleteFile()` - shows confirmation
- ✅ Implemented `handleDeleteConfirm()` - executes delete
- ✅ Implemented `handleDeleteCancel()` - closes dialog
- ✅ Updated `handleCommandExecute()` to route 'removeFile' command
- ✅ Added `<ConfirmDialog>` to JSX

**State Management**:
```typescript
const [deleteDialogOpen, setDeleteDialogOpen] = React.useState(false);
const [fileToDelete, setFileToDelete] = React.useState<{
    documentId: string;
    driveId: string;
    itemId: string;
    fileName: string;
} | null>(null);
```

## Technical Implementation

### Data Flow

**User Action** → **CommandBar ("Remove File")** → **handleCommandExecute** → **handleDeleteFile** (shows dialog) → **User Confirms** → **handleDeleteConfirm** → **FileDeleteService** → **SdapApiClient** + **Dataverse Update** → **Grid Refresh**

### Fields Cleared in Dataverse

When a file is deleted, the following fields are set to `null`:
```typescript
{
    sprk_hasfile: false,
    sprk_graphitemid: null,
    sprk_filesize: null,
    sprk_createddatetime: null,
    sprk_lastmodifieddatetime: null,
    sprk_etag: null,
    sprk_filepath: null
}
```

**Preserved Fields**:
- `sprk_documentid` (primary key)
- `sprk_documentname` (document name)
- `sprk_filename` (original file name - for history)
- `sprk_matter` (parent matter relationship)
- `sprk_containerid` (container lookup)
- All other metadata fields

### Error Handling

**Validation Errors**:
- No selection → Warning logged, no action
- Multiple selections → Warning logged, no action
- Missing required fields → Error logged, no action

**Delete Errors**:
- SPE file not found → Logged, continues to Dataverse update
- Dataverse update fails → Logged as PARTIAL FAILURE
- Network timeout → Error response in ServiceResult
- Permission denied → Error response in ServiceResult

**Dialog State**:
- Always cleared in `finally` block
- Prevents dialog from getting stuck open

## Build Results

### Successful Build
```
[11:46:25 PM] [build] Succeeded
Bundle size: 8.47 MiB (development)
Module count: 13 custom modules (up from 11)
Errors: 0
Warnings: 0
```

### Files Added/Modified

| File | Action | Size |
|------|--------|------|
| `components/ConfirmDialog.tsx` | Created | 74 lines |
| `services/FileDeleteService.ts` | Created | 136 lines |
| `components/UniversalDatasetGridRoot.tsx` | Modified | +107 lines |

### Bundle Size Impact

- **Before (Task 2)**: 7.47 MiB
- **After (Task 3)**: 8.47 MiB
- **Increase**: +1.0 MiB (+13.4%)

**Note**: Bundle size increase is due to Fluent UI Dialog components being added to the bundle. This is expected and within acceptable limits for development builds.

## Code Quality

### ESLint Compliance
- ✅ All rules passing
- ✅ React hooks dependencies correct
- ✅ No unused variables
- ✅ Proper TypeScript types

### TypeScript Compliance
- ✅ Strict mode enabled
- ✅ All types explicitly defined
- ✅ No implicit `any` types
- ✅ ServiceResult pattern for error handling
- ✅ Generic context type (`ComponentFramework.Context<unknown>`)

### React Best Practices
- ✅ useCallback for all event handlers
- ✅ Proper dependency arrays
- ✅ State cleared in finally blocks
- ✅ Dialog controlled via React state

## User Experience

### Delete Button Behavior

**Enabled When**:
- Exactly 1 record selected AND
- Record has file (`hasFile = true`)

**Disabled When**:
- No records selected OR
- Multiple records selected OR
- Selected record does not have file

**Interaction Flow**:
1. User selects record with file
2. User clicks "Remove File" button
3. Confirmation dialog appears with file name
4. User clicks "Cancel" → Dialog closes, no change
5. User clicks "Delete" → File deleted, dialog closes, grid refreshes

### Confirmation Dialog

**Title**: "Delete File"
**Message**: `Are you sure you want to delete "{fileName}"? This action cannot be undone.`
**Buttons**: "Cancel" (secondary), "Delete" (primary)

**UX Benefits**:
- Prevents accidental deletions
- Shows exact file name being deleted
- Clear warning about irreversibility
- Standard Fluent UI styling

---

## Integration with Existing Features

### CommandBar Integration
- ✅ "Remove File" button already existed
- ✅ Button enable/disable logic unchanged
- ✅ Icon remains `Delete24Regular`
- ✅ Routed via `onCommandExecute('removeFile')`

### Grid Integration
- ✅ Grid refreshes after delete
- ✅ Record remains visible with `hasFile = false`
- ✅ Uses existing `dataset.refresh()` pattern
- ✅ Selection state preserved

### API Integration
- ✅ Uses `SdapApiClient.deleteFile({ driveId, itemId })`
- ✅ Uses `context.webAPI.updateRecord()` for Dataverse
- ✅ Follows same pattern as download (Task 2)

## Known Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **No Undo**: Deleted files cannot be recovered via UI
2. **No Multi-Delete**: Users must delete files one at a time
3. **No Progress Indicator**: No visual feedback during delete
4. **Document Record Preserved**: Records remain in Dataverse (by design)

### Future Enhancements (Out of Scope for Sprint 7A)
- Add multi-file delete support
- Add progress toast notifications
- Add undo functionality (restore from recycle bin)
- Add soft delete option (mark for deletion)

## Key Design Decisions

### Why Not Delete the Dataverse Record?

**Decision**: Only delete the file from SPE, update Dataverse record to `hasFile = false`

**Rationale**:
1. **Data Integrity**: Document metadata may have relationships (Matter, Container)
2. **Audit Trail**: Preserves history of document creation/association
3. **User Intent**: User clicked "Remove File" not "Delete Document"
4. **Reversibility**: Future feature could allow re-uploading to same record

### Why Delete File Before Updating Dataverse?

**Decision**: Delete from SPE first, then update Dataverse

**Rationale**:
1. **Prevent Orphans**: If SPE delete fails, Dataverse still shows hasFile=true (correct state)
2. **Easier Recovery**: Partial failure leaves system in consistent state
3. **User Experience**: User sees file is gone when record updates
