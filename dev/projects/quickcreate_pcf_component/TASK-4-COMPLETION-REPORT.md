## Components NOT in Package (By Design)

### 1. Custom Page (Separate Deployment)

**Name:** sprk_documentuploaddialog_e52db
**Location:** Default Solution
**Reason:** Created directly in Power Apps Maker Portal during Task 1
**Status:** Already deployed in SPAARKE DEV 1
**Action Required:** Document in deployment guide (DONE)

### 2. Ribbon Customizations (Separate Solutions)

**Solutions:** DocumentRibbons, MatterRibbons
**Reason:** Managed in entity-specific solutions
**Status:** Already deployed with RibbonDiff.xml
**Action Required:** Note dependency in deployment guide (DONE)

### Architectural Note

This distributed architecture is **normal and acceptable** for mature Dataverse environments:
- **UniversalQuickCreate solution** = PCF Control + supporting web resources
- **Default Solution** = Custom Pages (platform components)
- **Entity Solutions** = Ribbon customizations per entity

This separation allows:
- Independent versioning of components
- Easier rollback of specific components
- Reduced deployment complexity
- Better solution layering

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Issue 1: Custom Page Not in Package

**Problem:** Custom Page (sprk_documentuploaddialog_e52db) is NOT included in UniversalQuickCreate solution.

**Why:** Created directly in Default Solution during Task 1, not added to UniversalQuickCreate solution.

**Impact:**
- When deploying to NEW environment, Custom Page must be deployed separately
- When deploying to SPAARKE DEV 1, no impact (already exists)

**Mitigation:**
- Documented in DEPLOYMENT-PACKAGE.md ✅
- Provided manual deployment steps ✅
- Provided export/import alternative ✅

**Priority:** LOW (existing environment), MEDIUM (new environments)

### Issue 2: Ribbon Customizations in Separate Solutions

**Problem:** Ribbon customizations are in DocumentRibbons/MatterRibbons solutions, not in UniversalQuickCreate.

**Why:** Normal Dataverse architecture - ribbons managed per entity.

**Impact:**
- Ribbon buttons must exist in target environment
- OR DocumentRibbons solution must be deployed separately

**Mitigation:**
- Documented dependency ✅
- Exported DocumentRibbons_backup.zip for reference ✅
- Deployment guide includes verification steps ✅

**Priority:** LOW (acceptable architecture)

### Issue 3: Solution File Not Committed to Git

**Problem:** UniversalQuickCreate_3_0_0_0.zip is in .gitignore and not committed.

**Why:** Binary files should not be in git (172 KB).

**Impact:**
- Solution file must be stored in release artifacts
- OR regenerated from source using `pac solution export`

**Mitigation:**
- All SOURCE files ARE committed ✅
- Solution can be regenerated from source ✅
- Documented in commit message ✅

**Priority:** VERY LOW (standard practice)

---

## Deployment Strategy

### For SPAARKE DEV 1 (Current Environment)

**Status:** Components already deployed via `pac pcf push`

**Next Steps (Task 6):**
- Re-import solution to verify package integrity
- Publish all customizations
- Run smoke tests (Task 5)

### For New Environment (UAT/PROD)

**Required Deployments:**
1. UniversalQuickCreate_3_0_0_0.zip (THIS package)
2. Custom Page (manual creation OR export from DEV)
3. DocumentRibbons solution (if not already deployed)

**Order:**
1. Deploy Custom Page first
2. Deploy UniversalQuickCreate solution
3. Verify ribbon buttons exist
4. Test end-to-end

- ✅ Custom Page exists and is published
- ✅ Ribbon buttons configured

**Ready to Begin:** YES

### Task 6: DEV Deployment (4h)

**Objectives:**
1. Re-import solution to verify deployment process
2. Verify all components deploy correctly
3. Test rollback procedure
4. Document deployment results

**Prerequisites Met:**
- ✅ Solution package ready
- ✅ Deployment guide complete
- ✅ Components tested (will be after Task 5)

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Distributed Solution Architecture

**Learning:** Mature Dataverse environments often have components distributed across multiple solutions.

**Impact:** This is NORMAL and ACCEPTABLE. Don't force all components into one solution.

**Best Practice:** Document dependencies clearly in deployment guide.

### 2. pac pcf push Auto-Deploys

**Learning:** `pac pcf push` automatically builds, deploys, and publishes the PCF control.

**Impact:** Step 4.1 was already complete when we started Task 4 (ran in background).

**Best Practice:** Run `pac pcf push` BEFORE exporting solution to ensure latest version is included.

### 3. Solution Versioning is Separate from Component Versioning

**Learning:** Solution version (3.0.0.0) is different from PCF control version.

**Impact:** Need to update both:
- PCF version in ControlManifest.Input.xml
- Solution version via `pac solution online-version`

**Best Practice:** Keep versions synchronized for clarity.

### 4. .gitignore Excludes Binary Files

**Learning:** Solution .zip files are excluded from git (correctly).

**Impact:** Solution packages must be stored in release artifacts or SharePoint.

**Best Practice:** Commit all SOURCE files, regenerate packages as needed.

## Risk Assessment

### Deployment Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Custom Page missing in target env | MEDIUM | HIGH | Manual deployment guide provided |
| Ribbon buttons missing | LOW | HIGH | Verify DocumentRibbons solution deployed |
| Version mismatch | LOW | MEDIUM | Version verification in deployment guide |
| Import fails | LOW | HIGH | Rollback procedure documented |

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Large bundle size (603 KB) | N/A | LOW | Acceptable for PCF, lazy loading |
| Browser compatibility | LOW | MEDIUM | Test in multiple browsers (Task 5) |
| Performance degradation | LOW | MEDIUM | Performance testing (Task 5) |
