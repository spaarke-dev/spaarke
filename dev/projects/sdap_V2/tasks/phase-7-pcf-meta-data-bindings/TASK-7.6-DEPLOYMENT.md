# Task 7.6: Deployment and Documentation

**Task ID:** 7.6
**Phase:** 7 (Navigation Property Metadata Service)
**Assignee:** DevOps / Technical Lead
**Estimated Duration:** 2-4 hours
**Dependencies:** Task 7.5 (Testing complete and passing)
**Status:** Not Started

---

## Task Prompt

**IMPORTANT: Before starting this task, execute the following steps:**

1. **Read and validate this task document** against current deployment state
2. **Verify Task 7.5 complete:**
   - All critical tests passing
   - Performance targets met (cache hit rate >95%)
   - Security validation complete
   - Test results documented
3. **Review deployment order (CRITICAL):**
   - **FIRST:** Deploy Spe.Bff.Api with NavMapController
   - **SECOND:** Deploy PCF v2.3.0 with NavMapClient
   - **REASON:** BFF changes are additive; PCF can fall back if BFF unavailable
4. **Prepare deployment artifacts:**
   - BFF: Published build of Spe.Bff.Api
   - PCF: Solution package with v2.3.0 control
   - Configuration: appsettings.json with parent entities list
5. **Confirm rollback plan:** Understand how to revert if issues occur
6. **Update this document** if any deployment steps are missing
7. **Commit any documentation updates** before beginning deployment

---

## Objectives

Deploy Phase 7 to production with zero downtime:

1. ✅ **BFF Deployment:** Deploy NavMapController to Spe.Bff.Api (FIRST)
2. ✅ **BFF Validation:** Verify endpoint accessible and returning metadata
3. ✅ **PCF Deployment:** Deploy v2.3.0 to Dataverse (SECOND)
4. ✅ **PCF Validation:** Verify control loads and uses server metadata
5. ✅ **End-to-End Verification:** Test document upload with server metadata
6. ✅ **Monitoring Setup:** Configure alerts and dashboards
7. ✅ **Documentation:** Update admin guides and runbooks
8. ✅ **Communication:** Notify stakeholders of deployment
9. ✅ **Post-Deployment Monitoring:** Watch metrics for 24-48 hours

---

## Deployment Order (CRITICAL)

### Why BFF First, PCF Second?

**BFF Changes (Task 7.2):**
- **Additive only:** New NavMapController endpoint
- **No breaking changes:** Existing upload endpoints unchanged
- **Backward compatible:** PCF v2.2.0 continues to work (doesn't call new endpoint)

**PCF Changes (Tasks 7.3-7.4):**
- **Depends on BFF:** Calls `/api/pcf/dataverse-navmap` for metadata
- **Has fallback:** Uses Layer 2 (cache) or Layer 3 (hardcoded) if BFF unavailable
- **Can deploy after BFF:** Safely uses new endpoint once available

**Risk Mitigation:**
1. Deploy BFF → Test endpoint → Confirm working
2. Deploy PCF → PCF uses new endpoint OR falls back gracefully
3. If issues: Keep PCF v2.2.0, troubleshoot BFF, redeploy

**NEVER deploy PCF before BFF:** PCF would try to call non-existent endpoint (though fallback handles this)

---

4. Save and publish form if needed

**Repeat for all entities:**
- sprk_matter
- sprk_project (if configured)
- sprk_invoice (if configured)
- account (if configured)
- contact (if configured)

---

#### 2.4: Verify PCF Deployment

**Browser Test:**

1. Open Dataverse environment
2. Navigate to Matter record
3. Open browser DevTools → Console
4. Observe PCF initialization logs

**Expected Console Output:**

```
[NavMapClient] Starting NavMap load with 3-layer fallback
[NavMapClient] Layer 1: Attempting server fetch...
[NavMapClient] Layer 1 SUCCESS - Loaded from server
  entityCount: 5
  entities: ["sprk_matter", "sprk_project", "sprk_invoice", "account", "contact"]
[NavMapClient] Cached NavMap to session storage
[DocumentRecordService] Using server metadata for 'sprk_matter'
```

**Validation:**
- [ ] PCF control loads without errors
- [ ] Console shows "Layer 1 SUCCESS"
- [ ] Server metadata loaded (not fallback)
- [ ] Form remains functional

---

### STEP 3: End-to-End Verification

#### 3.1: Upload Test (Matter Entity)

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to Matter record
2. Click "Upload Document"
3. Select test file
4. Fill in metadata
5. Click "Upload"

**Expected:**

- [ ] Account entity (if configured)
- [ ] Contact entity (if configured)

**Validation:**
- [ ] All configured entities working
- [ ] Server metadata used for each
- [ ] Navigation properties correct (verify case)

---

#### 3.3: Fallback Test (Layer 2 Cache)

**Steps:**
1. Refresh page (session cache populated from previous test)
2. Upload another document

**Expected Console Output:**
```
[NavMapClient] Layer 2 HIT - Loaded from cache
```

**Validation:**
- [ ] Cache used on second load
- [ ] No server fetch (Layer 1 skipped)
- [ ] Upload still succeeds

---

### STEP 4: Monitoring Setup

#### 4.1: Application Insights Queries

**Create custom queries for monitoring:**

**Query 1: NavMap Cache Hit Rate**

```kusto
customEvents
| where name == "NavMapLoaded"
| extend layer = tostring(customDimensions.layer)
| summarize count() by layer
| extend hitRate = todouble(count_) / toscalar(
    customEvents
    | where name == "NavMapLoaded"
    | count
  ) * 100
```

**Expected:** Layer 2 (cache) >95%

---

**Query 2: Document Creation Success Rate**

```kusto
customEvents
| where name == "DocumentCreated" or name == "DocumentCreateFailed"
| summarize successCount = countif(name == "DocumentCreated"),
            failCount = countif(name == "DocumentCreateFailed")
| extend successRate = todouble(successCount) / todouble(successCount + failCount) * 100
```

**Expected:** >99% success rate

---

**Query 3: NavMap Endpoint Performance**

```kusto
requests
| where url contains "/api/pcf/dataverse-navmap"
| summarize avg(duration), percentile(duration, 95), percentile(duration, 99) by bin(timestamp, 1h)
```

**Expected:**
- Avg: <100ms (cache hit)
- P95: <500ms (cache miss)

---

#### 4.2: Alerts Configuration

**Create alerts in Azure Monitor:**

**Alert 1: NavMap Endpoint Failures**
- **Condition:** Status code 500, count >5 in 5 minutes
- **Action:** Email DevOps, create incident

**Alert 2: Document Creation Failures**
- **Condition:** customEvents where name == "DocumentCreateFailed", count >10 in 15 minutes
- **Action:** Email support team

**Alert 3: Cache Hit Rate Drop**
- **Condition:** Layer 1 calls >20% of total (indicates cache not working)
- **Action:** Email DevOps for investigation

---

#### 4.3: Dashboard Creation

**Create Power BI or Azure Dashboard with:**
- NavMap endpoint request count (hourly)
- Cache hit rate (real-time)
- Document creation success rate (hourly)
- Average response time (P50, P95, P99)
- Error count by type (5xx, 4xx, client errors)

---

### STEP 5: Documentation Updates

- [ ] Cache hit rate: ___% (target >95%)
- [ ] Avg response time: ___ms (target <100ms)
- [ ] P95 response time: ___ms (target <500ms)

**Reliability:**
- [ ] Document creation success rate: ___% (target >99%)
- [ ] NavMap endpoint uptime: ___% (target 100%)
- [ ] Error count: ___ (target 0)

**Usage:**
- [ ] Total uploads: ___
- [ ] Unique users: ___
- [ ] Entities used: ___ (Matter, Project, etc.)

**User Feedback:**
- [ ] Support tickets: ___ (expect 0 related to this change)
- [ ] User complaints: ___ (expect 0)

**Decision:**
- [ ] ✅ Deployment successful, continue monitoring
- [ ] ⚠️ Issues found, create action items
- [ ] ❌ Critical issues, execute rollback

---

### STEP 8: Rollback Plan (If Needed)

#### Rollback Scenario 1: PCF Issues (Minor)

**Symptoms:**
- PCF not loading metadata from server
- Console errors in client
- Upload still works (fallback to config)

**Action:**
1. Investigate client-side logs
2. Check BFF endpoint accessibility
3. Verify token acquisition
4. Fix client code and redeploy PCF

**No BFF rollback needed:** Server side still working

---

#### Rollback Scenario 2: BFF Issues (Moderate)

**Symptoms:**
- NavMap endpoint returning errors
- Server performance degraded
- Metadata incorrect

**Action:**
1. Keep PCF v2.3.0 deployed (has fallback)
2. Rollback BFF to previous version:

```bash
# Swap deployment slots (if using slots)
az webapp deployment slot swap \
  --resource-group <resource-group> \
  --name <app-service-name> \
  --slot staging \
  --target-slot production

# Or redeploy previous version
az webapp deployment source config-zip \
  --resource-group <resource-group> \
  --name <app-service-name> \
  --src previous-deployment.zip
```

3. PCF falls back to Layer 3 (hardcoded values)
4. Upload continues to work for configured entities

---

#### Rollback Scenario 3: Complete Rollback (Critical)

**Symptoms:**
- Document uploads failing
- Multiple errors across entities
- User impact severe

**Action:**
1. **Rollback PCF first:**

```bash
# Export and remove v2.3.0 solution
pac solution delete --solution-name UniversalQuickCreateSolution

# Reimport v2.2.0
pac solution import --path UniversalQuickCreateSolution_v2.2.0.zip
pac solution publish
```

2. **Rollback BFF second:**
   - Redeploy previous BFF version (see Scenario 2)

3. **Verify Phase 6 working:**
   - Test upload with PCF v2.2.0
   - Confirm hardcoded navigation properties used

4. **Document issues:**
   - Create incident report
   - Root cause analysis
   - Fix before retry
