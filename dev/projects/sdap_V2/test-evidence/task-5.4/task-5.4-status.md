# Task 5.4: Script Updated & Ready

**Date**: 2025-10-14
**Status**: SCRIPT READY (testing blocked by admin consent)

## Script Updates Applied

1. Fixed upload route: `/api/obo/containers/{containerId}/files/{path}`
2. Changed DRIVE_ID to CONTAINER_ID (per ADR-011)
3. Updated function signatures
4. Added ADR-011 documentation

## What Would Be Tested

- Complete auth chain (PCF → BFF → OBO → Graph → SPE)
- File operations (upload, download, delete)
- Content integrity (no silent failures)
- Cache performance (Phase 4 verification)

## Status

✅ Script updated and ready
⏳ Testing blocked by admin consent (same as Tasks 5.1-5.3)
⏳ Defer to production testing (Task 5.9) OR grant admin consent

## Impact

This is expected - Azure CLI limitation, not BFF API problem.
Production uses MSAL.js (different auth path, no consent issue).
