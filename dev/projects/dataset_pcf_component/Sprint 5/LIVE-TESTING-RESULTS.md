## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Today)

1. **Document Entity Types Tested**
   - Record which specific entities were tested
   - Note any entity-specific observations
   - Document subgrid relationships tested

2. **Test Edge Cases**
   - Try with entity with 50+ records (virtualization not available in minimal version)
   - Test with entity with many columns (15+)
   - Test with lookup fields

3. **Browser Testing**
   - Current browser worked (assumed Edge/Chrome)
   - Test in Firefox, Safari if needed

### Short-term Actions (This Week)

4. **Gather User Feedback**
   - What features are most needed?
   - Is minimal version sufficient?
   - Performance acceptable with typical record counts?

5. **Performance Testing**
   - Test with larger datasets (50, 100, 200 records)
   - Measure load times
   - Identify any slow scenarios

6. **Accessibility Testing**
   - Test keyboard navigation
   - Test with screen reader (if accessibility required)

### Medium-term Actions (Next Sprint)

7. **Enhancement Planning**
   - Based on feedback, decide:
     - Option A: Optimize full version (React + Fluent UI)
     - Option B: Enhance minimal version
     - Option C: Keep minimal version as-is

8. **Production Deployment**
   - If testing continues to be successful
   - Deploy to UAT/Staging environment
   - Plan production rollout

## Next Steps for Testing

### Additional Test Scenarios

#### 1. Large Dataset Test
**Goal**: Verify performance with 100+ records
**Steps**:
1. Find/create entity with 100+ records
2. Add control to view or form
3. Measure load time
4. Note any performance issues

**Expected**: May be slow (no virtualization in minimal version)

#### 2. Complex Entity Test
**Goal**: Test with complex entity (many columns, lookups)
**Steps**:
1. Use entity with 15+ columns
2. Include lookup fields
3. Verify all data types render

**Expected**: Should work, but may have wide horizontal scroll

#### 3. Permission Test
**Goal**: Verify control respects security
**Steps**:
1. Test with user having limited permissions
2. Verify only accessible records shown
3. Check field-level security respected

**Expected**: Should respect Dataverse permissions

#### 4. Refresh/Update Test
**Goal**: Verify data updates correctly
**Steps**:
1. Display records in grid
2. Update a record in another window
3. Click "Refresh" button
4. Verify updated data appears

**Expected**: Should show updated data after refresh

#### 5. Selection Test
**Goal**: Verify selection persists appropriately
**Steps**:
1. Select multiple records
2. Scroll or interact with grid
3. Verify selection maintained
4. Click "Clear Selection"
5. Verify selection cleared

**Expected**: Selection should work as documented
