---

## Decision Point: What's Next?

You have three paths forward:

### **Option A: Use Minimal Version As-Is** ⭐ Fastest
**Timeline**: Complete (no additional work)
**Effort**: 0 hours
**Best For**: If current functionality meets your needs

**Pros**:
- ✅ Already working
- ✅ Fast and lightweight (9.89 KiB)
- ✅ Supports all entity types
- ✅ Works in forms, subgrids, views

**Cons**:
- ❌ No advanced features
- ❌ Limited customization
- ❌ May struggle with 100+ records

**When to Choose**: If you primarily need basic grid display and current features are sufficient.

---

### **Option B: Enhance Minimal Version** ⭐ Recommended
**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks
**Effort**: 16-24 hours
**Best For**: Adding specific features while keeping bundle small

**Enhancement Priority List**:

#### Phase 1: Configuration Support (4 hours)
- Add JSON configuration parsing
- Support view mode setting (Grid/List)
- Enable/disable commands via config
- **Benefit**: Customizable per entity without code changes

#### Phase 2: List View Mode (4 hours)
- Implement simple list rendering
- Support primary + secondary fields
- Add view mode toggle
- **Benefit**: Better for narrow spaces, mobile

#### Phase 3: Virtual Scrolling (6 hours)

**Total**: 20 hours = 2-3 days of focused development

**Pros**:
- ✅ Keeps bundle small (<50 KiB estimated)
- ✅ Adds most-requested features
- ✅ Maintains performance
- ✅ Quick to deploy

**Cons**:
- ❌ Still no fancy UI (no Fluent UI components)
- ❌ No icons (unless we solve bundle size)
- ❌ Manual coding required

**When to Choose**: If you need configuration flexibility and better performance, but don't need polished UI.

## Recommended Path

Based on successful minimal deployment, we recommend:

### **Start with Option B (Enhanced Minimal)**

**Why**:
1. ✅ Quick wins (1-2 weeks vs 3-4 weeks)
2. ✅ Addresses key limitations (config, performance)
3. ✅ Low risk (proven deployment method)
4. ✅ Can always upgrade to Option C later

**Then Evaluate**:
- After Option B, gather feedback
- If users need more polish/features → Proceed to Option C
- If Option B is sufficient → Stay minimal and invest elsewhere
