## Last completed task

**Task 001 — D-P1 InsightArtifact envelope POCOs** ✅ (2026-05-28)
- Files: `Models/Insights/{InsightArtifact,EvidenceRef,DeclineResponse}.cs` + `tests/.../InsightArtifactTests.cs`
- Tests: 7/7 pass (standalone runner); test project Sprk.Bff.Api.Tests has pre-existing compile errors unrelated to this task
- Build: `dotnet build src/server/api/Sprk.Bff.Api/` clean — zero new warnings
- SPEC §3.5.4 forbidden-imports grep: clean
- Quality gates: code-review ✅ / adr-check ✅
- Foundation type for D-P3, D-P4, D-P6, D-P10, D-P11, D-P14, D-P15 (all downstream tasks consume this envelope)

## Next action

Pick next 🔲 task from [tasks/TASK-INDEX.md](tasks/TASK-INDEX.md). Wave 1 has task 002 (D-P17 `IInsightGraph` stub) — parallel-safe to 001 (no shared files). Then Wave 2 (D-P2 + D-P3) unlocks once the parallel-safe foundation work completes.

## Context recovery

If a session is compacted or interrupted, this file is the entry point for recovery:

1. Read this file to see active task state
2. Read [tasks/TASK-INDEX.md](tasks/TASK-INDEX.md) for progress
3. Read [SPEC.md](SPEC.md) §3.1 for canonical deliverable list
4. Read [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for project-scoped instructions
5. Read root [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md) §4 for the mandatory task-execute protocol
6. Invoke `task-execute` for whatever task is `in_progress` (or pick the next 🔲 from the index)

## Decision log (per task)

### Task 001 (D-P1) — completed 2026-05-28

- Use C# **records** (immutable) over classes — matches POML "Record types" wording, cleaner serialization, no accidental mutation in pipelines.
- **`PrecedentArtifact`** does NOT carry `confidence` on the wire (matches SPEC §3.4.2 worked example `"confidence": null`; Precedents are SME-confirmed per D-46) and adds **`Status`** (lifecycle state per design §2.1 + SPEC §3.4.2 `"status": "confirmed"`).
- **`Value.Raw`** typed as `JsonElement` — preserves arbitrary JSON shapes (string enum, integer, nested Precedent object) without custom converters.
- **Polymorphism**: `[JsonPolymorphic(TypeDiscriminatorPropertyName = "type")]` + `[JsonDerivedType]` for each tier — standard System.Text.Json idiom; no custom converter needed.
- **Pre-existing test infrastructure breakage** (EmbeddingMigrationService / AppOnlyDocumentAnalysisJobHandler / EmailAnalysisJobHandler types missing from Sprk.Bff.Api) — verified pre-existing by stashing my changes and confirming build still fails with same 7 errors. Out of scope for task 001; should be tracked separately as test-cleanup work.
