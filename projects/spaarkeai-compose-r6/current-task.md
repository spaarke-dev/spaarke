# Current Task — Spaarke Compose R6

> Active-task tracker for context recovery. Reset per root `CLAUDE.md` §7 as tasks complete.

## Status: Phase 0 complete — STOPPED before Phase 1 (human gating required)

- **Project**: `spaarkeai-compose-r6`
- **Branch**: `work/spaarkeai-compose-r6`
- **Phase**: 0 Foundations & gates — ✅ COMPLETE (001, 002, 003, 004 all ✅)
- **Active task**: none
- **Next task**: 010 — Route Imported docs through render-from-model (Phase 1, FULL, opus/xhigh) — **NOT auto-started**
- **Next action**: human decision to begin Phase 1 (see "Phase-1 gating" below)

### Phase 0 — ✅ complete (2026-08-05)
- **001** ✅ ADR-049 R6 Path-B amendment (render-on-save supersedes I-4 + line-40, save path only). Committed `511976d7f`.
- **002** ✅ SPE versioning = append-only (unconditional new-version PUT). `notes/spe-versioning-verify.md`.
  - ⚠️ **Operational dependency**: SPE retention depends on per-container-type `isVersioningEnabled=true` + `majorVersionLimit` (admin config, not a code guarantee) — must be confirmed per environment for FR-07's safety net.
  - 🔔 **Human gate**: live v3-after-v4 byte-intact confirmation in the deployed Documents/SPE surface.
  - FR-07 needs: NEW OBO version-LIST endpoint; can REUSE `DownloadFileVersionAsUserAsync:842` for open-prior.
- **003** ✅ Publish baseline **48.25 MB compressed incl. PDBs** (−1.38 MB vs 49.63 MB ref; 11.75 MB headroom to 60 MB). `notes/publish-baseline.md`. Baseline CVE (pre-existing): `System.Security.Cryptography.Xml` 8.0.3 (5 High) — R6 tasks must not add NEW HIGH CVEs.
- **004** ✅ `AppligentNDA_Signed.docx` moved to `tests/fixtures/compose-corpus/` (LFS) + manifest row #14 (§1.6). Empirically confirmed the 422 root cause: **7 `mc:AlternateContent` pairs, 12 `w:txbxContent`, 3 duplicate `w14:paraId`** in the signature block. `notes/nda-fixture-coverage.md`.
  - Step 9.5 override note: touches `tests/**` but changed no test CODE (binary fixture + manifest markdown only) → code-review/adr-check N/A (documented rationale).

### Phase-1 gating (why autonomous execution stops here)
Phase 1 (010/011/012/013/014) is the render-on-save code pivot: FULL rigor, opus/xhigh, **most-contested BFF surface** (`Services/Compose/`). Before it runs it needs (human-in-loop):
1. The **ADR-049 amendment merged to master** with/before the Phase-1 code (Path-B obligation).
2. **`/conflict-check` before the BFF PR** (active overlap with compose-r5 on `ComposeService.cs`).
3. Real code changes + Step 9.5 code-review/adr-check + a deploy/UAT gate (014) on the NDA.
These are not safe to run fully unattended — resume Phase 1 deliberately.

## Notes
- Scaffold generated 2026-08-05 via `/project-pipeline` (scaffold-and-stop mode; task execution NOT started).
- Task 001 (ADR-049 amendment) MUST merge with or before Phase-1 code (010–014).
- Phase 0 tasks 002 (SPE versioning verify) + 003 (publish-size baseline) are human/verify gates.
- `Services/Compose/` is the most-contested surface — run `/conflict-check` before every BFF PR.
