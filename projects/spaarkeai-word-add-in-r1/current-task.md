## Quick Recovery (READ THIS FIRST)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Task** | **Wave W5+ in flight (2026-09-11)** — **013** (client identity wiring, sonnet), **016** (office-save contract tests + identity-route coverage, sonnet), **030** (Matter creation service, opus) |
| **Status** | **013 ✅ and 016 ✅ merged** (`8b5d58a2b`, `c475ed764`); gates on the merged tree: office-addins prod typecheck 0, build green (needs the 4 env vars — CI supplies them; locally use placeholders), jest 10 failing suites = pre-existing baseline, 013's 2 new suites added to `ci-gated-suites.txt`. **030 🔄 rework** (agent resumed with context): owner moved matter numbering to a SEPARATE project (server-side, on record create, NO plugin) and made Matter Type required-but-never-rejected — see project CLAUDE.md Decisions 2026-09-11. **Needs a new client task**: required Matter Type field on pane quick-create (`SaveFlow.tsx` posts `{name}` only). |
| **State at dispatch** | Main tree clean, 0/0 with origin, PR #960 CI green. Agents were told: do NOT edit current-task.md / TASK-INDEX.md / project CLAUDE.md (main session owns them); do NOT push, PR, deploy or trigger workflows; commit on their worktree branch only; no `--no-verify`. File ownership: 013 = `src/client/office-addins/**`; 016 = `tests/integration/**` + owns any shared contract-fixture change; 030 = `Services/Office/*` QuickCreate path + `OfficeEndpoints.cs` + a NEW `OfficeQuickCreateContractTests.cs` (no shared-fixture edits). 030 may do READ-ONLY Dataverse GETs via an az token; never writes. |
| **Next Action** | When each agent reports: review its diff in its worktree branch, then merge into `work/spaarkeai-word-add-in-r1`. After all three, run `dotnet build` + ArchTests + the affected BFF tests + office-addins typecheck/build/jest; update TASK-INDEX + this file; paste 030's Placement Justification (`notes/030-creation-service-decisions.md`) into the PR #960 body; `/conflict-check`; push. **Held back on purpose:** 014 and 023 both write 016's `OfficeEndpointsContractTests.cs` → start after 016 lands (023 is the critical path: 013 → 023 → 024). 020/021/022 (W7) wait on 013. |

### What 013 must honour from 012 (notes/012 §2, "Rules for task 013")
- **503 = could not determine.** Retry or let the user choose; never treat it as a new document.
- **A 403 with `reasonCode` `sdap.access.error.system_failure` is indeterminate too.**
- **Don't call the route for an empty or non-absolute `document.url`** (an unsaved document). Treat it as new locally.
- **`identity_conflict` is not "new"**: do not offer save-as-new.
- Word desktop and web both return the raw-space path form (spike-1 §19, §23). Send it exactly as returned.

### Last session (2026-09-10 → 11) — all committed + pushed to PR #960
- **012:** `8fec97b2d` (resolver + route), then `9750b4968` (Graph 403 → `not_resolvable`, after the live evidence). It was deployed twice to `spaarke-bff-dev` via `/bff-deploy`, hash-verified and healthy. Decisions are in `notes/012-identity-resolver-decisions.md`; the live table is in §8.
- **015:** `aff1ca9e4` (agent, isolated worktree) plus `4ea3cf6de` (corrected stale "waits on 032" claims). The add-in site was redeployed (run 34546485352), and Find is live for Word and Outlook.
- **Gates:** full `Sprk.Bff.Api.Tests` 12,139/0; ArchTests 191; no CVE; publish +0.016 MB against a fresh master build.
- **This worktree** now has root `node_modules`, so the husky/lint-staged pre-commit hook runs. Never `--no-verify`.

### Completed after the handoff — doc accuracy pass (committed with this update)

The background doc-accuracy agent finished and its edits were verified in the main session before commit:
8 files, no workflow YAML touched, the one C# change comment-only. It corrected the admin guide + deployment
checklist (non-existent `manifest-working.xml`, `build:prod`, the `localhost` trap), `uac-access-control.md`
(the stale app-only claim), `.github/WORKFLOWS.md` + the incident runbook (only `Router` is required; three
undocumented workflows added), `src/client/office-addins/CLAUDE.md` and the architecture doc (React 19, build
command, typecheck count), and the `ChatWordExportEndpoints.cs` URL-shape comment.

**It caught two errors in the main session's own brief — keep these:**
- **Outlook's production XML is `/outlook/outlook-manifest.xml`, NOT `/outlook/manifest.xml`** (404 vs 200,
  verified). Only Word's XML output is named `manifest.xml`. Word URL: `/word/manifest.xml` (200, serves 1.0.8.0).
- The Word adapter consolidation (task 010) was already documented correctly; the brief over-claimed that.
- Typecheck: 289 test-file errors at the 2026-09-09 accept decision; 284 on re-measure 2026-09-10; 0 production.

### Operator pending (none can be done by an agent)

1. ~~Word DESKTOP capture~~ **DONE 2026-09-11.** The desktop value is byte-identical to the web capture and resolves
   (spike-1 §23).
2. **Re-upload the Word manifest at 1.0.8.0** — the operator uploaded from the SWA while it still served 1.0.7.0.
   The SWA now serves 1.0.8.0 (verified). Path: M365 Admin Center → Settings → Integrated apps →
   `https://icy-desert-0bfdbb61e.6.azurestaticapps.net/word/manifest.xml`. Then confirm the pane footer = 1.0.8 →
   **task 011 can close** (via the XML path). Outlook needs no re-upload (1.0.22.0, unchanged; its XML is
   `/outlook/outlook-manifest.xml`).
3. **Optional (012):** the URL of any OneDrive or SharePoint file that has no Spaarke record, to exercise the
   Dataverse not-found shape live (notes/012 §8). The az CLI cannot list OneDrive (AADSTS65002), and the BFF has no
   route that lists container children.
4. **Share privilege check** — security roles → `sprk_document` → Share. If it is not granted, the record⇔document
   access model has no gap (see D-032-1). OR reconnect Dataverse MCP (`/mcp`) and an agent can check.
5. **Dataverse MCP has been DOWN** (`CONNECTION_CLOSED`). Nothing here was "verified via MCP". Use `/mcp` or a
   restart to reconnect.

### Pending decisions (operator)

- **Spike-1 §7 — stamp-as-primary.** Still recommended on its merits (identity by content survives a rename or a
  move), but it is no longer needed for viability: Spike-1 is GREEN. It cannot replace the URL path either, because
  014 stamps only the Office save path (notes/012 §1). The only thing left to decide is ORDER: 014 before or after
  013. Both are startable now.
- **Shadow-window latch mechanism** (ISS-002 residual) — `-Since` was advanced (Option 1, applied); the latch
  itself (`$falseGreens` unfiltered by `$countingFrom`) still exists and the NEXT false green will latch the same
  way. Needs a cutover-owner decision: hard stop or reset.

---

## Critical Context (the 5 things a fresh session must not re-learn the hard way)

1. **Docs and agent reports in this area have repeatedly been WRONG vs code.** Verify against code/live before
   relaying. Examples this session: ArchTests "broken" (false — concurrent-build contention), UAC doc "app-only"
   (stale 1 day; code is fail-closed caller-scoped), office-addins gate "PR-blocking" (false — only `Router` is a
   required check), `manifest-working.xml` (doesn't exist), `ChatWordExport` URL-shape comment (wrong).
2. **The access model is ENFORCED in code** (D-032-1 WITHDRAWN, final): record access ⇔ document access.
   Internal: `AuthorizationService` fails closed, queries Dataverse AS THE USER (`:54`, `:79`, `:224-225`).
   External: grants at ROOT record only; SPE broker-only (BFF app-only download, `ExternalProjectDataEndpoints`
   `DownloadDocumentContent`); `GrantMembershipAsync` has no callers. No code shares an individual row. Access is
   BU-assigned, never org-wide (operator). Cascade (Referential) was the WRONG question — it governs
   share/assign/delete propagation, which the model never uses.
3. **Link 2 cannot be tested outside the BFF** — only the owning app or a container-type-REGISTERED app reads SPE
   files. `az` CLI / Graph Explorer would 403 regardless of URL validity (false negative).
4. **Space encoding is the live link-2 question**: `document.url` returns RAW spaces; the BFF's own open-links
   returns `%20`. Same URL after decoding (shape check MATCH, spike-1 §21). Task 012 must test both forms.
5. **Many agents in ONE worktree** caused lost writes to shared files (TASK-INDEX, current-task) and phantom
   findings from build contention. Prefer separate worktrees for waves of build-heavy agents.

| Deploys | Office add-ins redeployed from this branch — SWA now serves **1.0.8.0** | runs `34414699298`, `34532444044` |

### Open findings surfaced, NOT yet actioned

- ~~**F-1**~~ **FIXED 2026-09-11** — `deploy-office-addins.yml` now watches
  `src/client/shared/Spaarke.Communication.Components/src/logic/connections/provenance.ts` (verified: webpack
  `webpack.config.js:101` aliases exactly that file; it has zero imports, so one path entry is complete).
- **W-5** `identity-obj-proxy` mapped in `jest.config.js:48` but not installed. **Verified INERT 2026-09-11**: no
  file in `src/client/office-addins` (source or test) imports a `.css/.less/.scss/.sass`, so the mapping is never
  resolved. Becomes live only when a stylesheet import is added. Fix after 013 lands (it owns office-addins this
  wave): install it as a devDependency, or drop the dead mapping.
- **W-2 (043)** manifest-line deletion from `ci-gated-suites.txt` — mitigated by CODEOWNERS, not mechanically.
- **W-7** CLAUDE.md §12 `npm ci` ban may not hold for office-addins (`npm ci --dry-run` exits 0) — §6.5 question.
- 10 failing jest suites (84 tests) — genuine mock/assertion defects, unowned by a task.
- F-6 `unified-access-control-r2` has a branch diff on the frozen `ci-tier1-blocking.yml` — operator's call.

## Decisions made (operator, this session)

- 2026-09-08 — FR-12 path **C then B**; **F-h owned by r1**, fix host-neutral.
- 2026-09-09 — Deferral policy: defer only with a good technical reason OR an ACTIVE hand-off (a note the other
  project is instructed to read — a GitHub issue alone is NOT a hand-off). D-032-2 folded into task 033.
- 2026-09-09 — FR-18 = production types only (A1+B1); 289 test-file errors consciously accepted.
- 2026-09-09 — React 19 stays; RTL aligns to it. ci-cd-unit-test-remediation-r1 is CLOSED → r1 owns CI work.
- 2026-09-09 — r1 owns ISS-002 (044) with authorization to touch frozen tier files (not exercised).
- 2026-09-10 — Legacy/existing documents don't matter (dev only). Shadow window Option 1 applied.
- 2026-09-10 — Access model confirmed as enforced; D-032-1 withdrawn (final).
- 2026-09-10 — Operator authorized agent-triggered deploys of `deploy-office-addins.yml`.
