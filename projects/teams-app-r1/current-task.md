## Quick Recovery (READ THIS FIRST)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Task** | **ALL non-deploy work ✅ (20/25).** ⏸️ **PAUSED before deploy** by operator directive. **001 🔄** (operator live Teams gate). |
| **Step** | Completed: 002,010,011,012,020,021,022,030,040,041,042,043,050,051,060,061,062,070,071,072. Remaining = DEPLOY TAIL only: 065 (BFF deploy) → 045 (PCF deploy) → 080 (live E2E) → 090 (wrap-up). |
| **Status** | ⏸️ Paused pre-deploy. Master synced + merged (pushed, branch current). All 4 waves + Teams-package stream committed & pushed. Every FULL task passed code-review + adr-check. Deploy tail is deliberately held for cross-project coordination. |
| **Next Action** | On operator go: 065 BFF deploy (coordinate on shared spaarke-bff-dev) → 045 PCF deploy (v1.0.11) → operator runs 001 spike live-validation + 080 E2E (needs live Teams) → 090 wrap-up (+ /test-diet, defer-issue: pre-existing System.Security.Cryptography.Xml 8.0.3 HIGH CVE; 041 internal-notify Path A/C decision). Backups: backup-teams-{wave4,premaster,postmaster}. |

### Files Modified This Session
- `notes/spikes/foundation-spike-findings.md` — code-verified go/no-go per path + operator runbook (NEW)
- `notes/spikes/teams-tab-spike/{README.md,manifest.json,index.html,teams-sso.js,config.sample.js}` — throwaway runnable spike (NEW)
- `.claude/adr/ADR-028-spaarke-auth-architecture.md` — **task 002**: applied Amendment A2 (workforce collaboration host)
- `projects/teams-app-r1/adr-028-amendment-draft.md` — DRAFT → APPLIED
- `.claude/CHANGELOG.md` — A2 amendment entry
- `tasks/002-adr-028-a2-amendment.poml` — status → completed
- `tasks/TASK-INDEX.md` — 001 → 🔄, 002 → ✅ + Wave 0 status note

### Critical Context
Code inspection found **NO architectural NO-GO**. Systemuser membership plane is wired end-to-end today (code-GO). Contact-only plane: `BuildFetchXml` `Contact` branch already binds `ContactId` (ADR-034 Path-C reuse VERIFIED), but the entry/normalization layers are systemuser-keyed and the endpoint 401s a no-systemuser caller (`MembershipEndpoints.cs:215-231`) — that gap **is** tasks 020/021, not a redesign. SPA/CIAM path is independent (no regression). The project's one true unknown = whether Teams SSO/NAA delivers a **BFF-valid workforce token in the desktop client** — inherently operator-run (a coding agent cannot sign into real Teams clients). No `src/` changes; spike is throwaway.

## Progress

### Completed Steps (autonomous)
- [x] Step 1 (adapted): verified the multitenant Entra app + membership endpoint contract by code inspection (no live manifest registration — operator step).
- [x] Step 3: systemuser plane resolution verified end-to-end (`ResolveSystemUserIdAsync` → `IdentityNormalizationService` → `MembershipResolverService.BuildFetchXml`).
- [x] Step 4: contact plane analyzed — `BuildFetchXml` `Contact` branch confirmed (ADR-034 Path C); entry-layer gap identified = tasks 020/021.
- [x] Step 5 (code): SPA/CIAM path confirmed independent (no regression surface).
- [x] Step 7: findings + explicit go/no-go per path recorded in `notes/spikes/foundation-spike-findings.md`.
- [x] Built throwaway operator-runnable scaffold `notes/spikes/teams-tab-spike/`.

### Pending (operator-gated)
- [ ] Step 2/6: live workforce-SSO token acquisition in Teams **desktop + web** (BFF-valid token).
- [ ] Step 4 (live): contact-only plane behavior in a real client (expected 401 today).
- [ ] Step 6: desktop-vs-web Conditional-Access differences captured.
- [ ] Overall GO recorded in findings §5 → only then set 001 ✅ and start Wave 1.

### Decisions This Task
- 2026-08-03: Did NOT mark 001 ✅ — the go/no-go is a live, human-operated validation (task `<escalation>` trigger + root CLAUDE.md §6). Autonomous work delivered code-verification + operator runbook + scaffold instead of a fabricated pass.

### Blockers
- Live Teams-client sign-in cannot be performed by an autonomous agent → operator must run the spike to close the gate.
