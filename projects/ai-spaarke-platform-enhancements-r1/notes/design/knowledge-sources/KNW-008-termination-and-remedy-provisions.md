## Overview

This reference document covers standard termination triggers, termination procedures, and remedy provisions found in commercial contracts. Understanding how and when a contract may be terminated — and what remedies are available — is among the most critical aspects of contract review. This document addresses termination for cause, termination for convenience, termination-related obligations, and the remedies available to non-defaulting parties.

## Part 1: Termination for Cause

### 1.1 Definition and Triggering Events

Termination for cause (also called "termination for default" or "termination for breach") is the right to end a contract due to the other party's failure to perform. The triggering events for termination for cause typically include:

**Material breach**:
- Failure to pay amounts due and not cured within a specified grace period (typically 5–10 days for payment defaults; 30 days for non-monetary defaults)
- Failure to deliver agreed deliverables within the contract schedule
- Delivery of non-conforming goods or services that fail acceptance testing
- Unauthorized assignment or sublicense of contract rights

**Insolvency and bankruptcy events**:
- Filing for voluntary bankruptcy or reorganization under any applicable insolvency law
- Commencement of involuntary bankruptcy proceedings not dismissed within 60–90 days
- Assignment for the benefit of creditors
- Appointment of a receiver or trustee
- Cessation of business operations

**Breach of representations and warranties**:
- Material false statement in the representations made at execution
- Failure of a condition that a party warranted would remain true throughout the term

**Regulatory and compliance events**:
- Loss of required licenses or regulatory approvals necessary to perform the contract
- Debarment from government contracting (for government or government-adjacent contracts)
- Conviction or plea of a party (or key personnel) for certain crimes

### 1.2 Notice and Cure Requirements

Most commercial contracts require the non-defaulting party to provide written notice before exercising a termination right. The notice period is followed by a cure period during which the defaulting party may remedy the breach.

**Standard notice and cure periods**:

| Default Type | Notice Required | Cure Period |
|---|---|---|
| Payment default | 5–10 days written notice | 5–10 days after notice |
| Non-monetary default | 30 days written notice | 30 days after notice (extendable) |
| Bankruptcy/insolvency | No cure required | N/A |
| Material misrepresentation | 30 days written notice | May not be curable |

**Extended cure period**: For defaults that cannot reasonably be cured within the standard cure period (e.g., a complex technical failure), most agreements permit the defaulting party to begin curing within the notice period and continue for a reasonable additional time, provided the party diligently pursues cure. Extended cure periods typically run 60–90 days from the original notice.

### 1.3 Automatic Termination vs. Right to Terminate

Some agreements distinguish between:
- **Automatic termination**: The contract terminates by operation of law upon the occurrence of a specified event (e.g., bankruptcy filing), without requiring a notice or election
- **Right to terminate**: The non-defaulting party has the right (but not the obligation) to elect termination upon occurrence of a default

For most commercial breaches, parties prefer a right to terminate (not automatic termination) to allow for commercial judgment about whether to enforce or waive.

## Part 2: Termination for Convenience

### 2.1 Definition

Termination for convenience (T4C) is the right to end a contract for any reason (or no reason) upon advance written notice, without the need to establish cause. T4C provisions are common in:
- Technology services contracts
- Managed services agreements
- Consulting and professional services contracts
- Government contracts (where they are mandatory in most forms)

### 2.2 Notice Period and Effective Date

Typical termination for convenience notice periods:
- **Short-term or month-to-month contracts**: 30 days notice
- **Standard annual contracts**: 60–90 days notice
- **Multi-year agreements or complex integrations**: 90–180 days notice

The effective date of termination is typically the end of the notice period unless the parties agree on an earlier date.

### 2.3 Termination-for-Convenience Fees

Contracts that lack a termination for convenience right from one party may be negotiated with a "break fee" or "termination fee" payable if the termination-for-convenience right is exercised during a specified locked-in period. For services contracts, termination fees may include:
- Unamortized setup costs
- Committed third-party costs (e.g., prepaid licenses)
- Lost profits on the remaining contract term (up to a negotiated cap)
- Wind-down labor costs

## Part 3: Post-Termination Obligations

### 3.1 Transition Assistance

Technology and services contracts frequently include a transition assistance obligation requiring the outgoing service provider to continue services and cooperate with the transition to a successor for a specified period (typically 90–180 days after termination notice). Transition assistance provisions should specify:
- Duration of the transition period
- Pricing for transition services (at contract rates, T&M, or a negotiated rate)
- Cooperation obligations (data export, documentation, knowledge transfer)
- Personnel availability during transition

### 3.2 Return and Destruction of Materials

Upon termination, each party typically has an obligation to:
- Return the other party's confidential information and proprietary materials
- Delete or destroy copies of the other party's data (with certification)
- Return physical property (equipment, access credentials, badges)

**Data return and export**: Cloud services and SaaS agreements should specify:
- The format in which customer data will be returned (export format, API availability)
- The period during which data will remain accessible for export (typically 30–90 days after termination)
- Data deletion certification timeline

### 3.3 Outstanding Payments

Upon termination, the parties must reconcile payment obligations:
- **For services completed**: Payment is due for all services performed and accepted through the termination effective date
- **For prepaid services**: Refund of prepaid amounts for services not yet rendered (subject to any applicable cancellation fees or early termination provisions)
- **Holdback/retainage**: Any held amounts become payable upon final reconciliation

### 3.4 Survival of Provisions

Certain provisions survive termination or expiration of the contract and remain binding on the parties. Commonly surviving provisions include:
- Confidentiality obligations (for the agreed survival period)
- IP ownership and license provisions
- Indemnification obligations (for claims arising from pre-termination conduct)
- Limitation of liability provisions
- Governing law and dispute resolution provisions
- Payment obligations for services rendered
- Audit rights for pre-termination periods

## Part 4: Remedies

### 4.1 Contractual vs. Non-Contractual Remedies

Parties may seek remedies through:
- **Contractual remedies**: Remedies specified in the contract (service credits, termination rights, liquidated damages)
- **Common law remedies**: Damages, rescission, restitution
- **Equitable remedies**: Injunctions, specific performance

### 4.2 Money Damages

**Types of compensable damages**:

- **Direct damages** (also called general damages or expectation damages): The difference between what the non-defaulting party received and what it was entitled to receive under the contract. Direct damages are recoverable in almost all breach of contract cases.

- **Consequential damages** (special damages): Losses that flow indirectly from the breach, such as lost profits, loss of business opportunity, and reputational harm. Consequential damages are the subject of the most heavily negotiated damage exclusion clauses in commercial contracts.

- **Incidental damages**: Expenses incurred by the non-breaching party in connection with a breach (e.g., cost of cover — procuring substitute services).

- **Reliance damages**: Expenses incurred by the non-defaulting party in reliance on the contract before the breach. Reliance damages are typically available as an alternative to expectation damages.

- **Restitution**: The return of benefits conferred on the defaulting party. Restitution may be available in cases of unjust enrichment.

### 4.3 Mutual Waiver of Consequential Damages

The most common damage limitation provision is a mutual waiver of consequential, indirect, incidental, special, and punitive damages:

> "IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES."

**Common carve-outs from the consequential damages waiver**:
- Breach of confidentiality obligations
- IP indemnification obligations
- Fraud or willful misconduct
- Gross negligence
- Payment obligations
- Death or personal injury

### 4.4 Liquidated Damages

Liquidated damages are pre-agreed amounts payable upon a specific breach (e.g., delay in delivery, failure to meet a specific performance metric). Liquidated damages provisions must:
- Represent a reasonable estimate of anticipated or actual harm at the time of contracting
- Not be so large as to constitute a penalty (penalties are unenforceable in most US jurisdictions)
- Address whether liquidated damages are the exclusive remedy for the specified breach

**Common liquidated damages provisions**:
- Delay damages: A daily or weekly rate for each day a deliverable is late
- SLA breach credits: A percentage of monthly fees for each SLA breach event
- Data breach damages: A fixed amount per affected record in data protection contexts

### 4.5 Injunctive and Equitable Relief

Injunctive relief — a court order requiring or prohibiting specific conduct — is particularly important in contracts involving:
- Misappropriation of trade secrets or confidential information
- IP infringement
- Breach of non-compete or non-solicitation obligations

Most confidentiality and IP provisions include an acknowledgment that:
- Breach causes irreparable harm not adequately compensable by money damages
- The non-defaulting party is entitled to seek injunctive or other equitable relief without posting a bond and without proving actual damages

### 4.6 Exclusive Remedy Provisions

Some agreements designate a specified remedy as the exclusive remedy for a specified type of breach. Common exclusive remedy provisions:
- **SLA credits as exclusive remedy**: Service credits are the sole and exclusive remedy for SLA breaches (no direct or consequential damages for availability issues)
- **Indemnification as exclusive IP remedy**: IP indemnification procedure is the exclusive remedy for IP infringement claims arising from the service

Exclusive remedy provisions are frequently resisted in the context of gross negligence, willful misconduct, or fraud.

## Part 5: Set-Off and Recoupment

### 5.1 Set-Off Rights

Set-off is the right to reduce the amount owed to a party by the amount owed by that party. Most commercial contracts either:
- **Grant set-off rights**: "Either party may set off amounts owed to it against amounts owed to the other party."
- **Restrict set-off rights**: "Neither party may withhold or set off any amounts owed under this Agreement against any claims it may have against the other party."

The ability to withhold payment against a disputed claim is a significant commercial right. Parties should confirm the set-off position before executing a contract.
