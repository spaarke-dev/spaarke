## Overview

This quick reference covers key employment law concepts relevant to reviewing employment agreements, offer letters, contractor agreements, and employment-related provisions in commercial contracts. It is written to be US-state agnostic and focuses on federal baseline principles, noting where state law commonly varies. This document does not provide legal advice and is not a substitute for jurisdiction-specific employment counsel.

## Part 1: Employment Relationships

### 1.1 At-Will Employment

The default employment relationship in most US states is "at-will," meaning either party — employer or employee — may terminate the relationship at any time, for any reason (or no reason), without prior notice, subject to exceptions.

**Key exceptions to at-will employment**:
- **Implied contracts**: Employee handbooks, offer letters, or verbal assurances that suggest job security may create implied contractual protections.
- **Anti-discrimination laws**: Termination cannot be based on protected characteristics (race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age [40+], disability, genetic information under federal law; additional categories under many state laws).
- **Public policy exceptions**: Termination that violates public policy (e.g., retaliating against an employee for exercising a legal right or reporting illegal activity) is actionable in most states.
- **Covenant of good faith and fair dealing**: Some states (notably California) recognize an implied covenant preventing bad-faith terminations.

### 1.2 Employee vs. Independent Contractor Classification

Misclassification of employees as independent contractors is one of the most significant employment law risks. Tests for classification vary by context (federal tax, labor law, benefits law), but common factors include:

**Behavioral control**:
- Does the company control how the worker performs the work?
- Are detailed instructions, training, and work schedules provided?

**Financial control**:
- Does the worker invest in their own tools and facilities?
- Is the worker free to work for multiple clients?
- Is the worker paid per project (independent contractor) or per hour/salary (employee)?

**Type of relationship**:
- Is there a written contract describing an independent contractor relationship?
- Does the worker receive employee benefits?
- Is the relationship permanent or for a specific project?

**California ABC Test** (among the most restrictive in the US):
Under California's AB5 (Labor Code 2775 et seq.), a worker is presumed to be an employee unless the hiring entity demonstrates all three of the following:
- (A) The worker is free from control and direction of the hiring entity
- (B) The worker performs work outside the usual course of the hiring entity's business
- (C) The worker is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, or business

## Part 2: Compensation and Hours

### 2.1 Federal Minimum Wage

The federal minimum wage is currently $7.25 per hour (Fair Labor Standards Act). Many states and localities have higher minimum wages. Employers must pay the highest applicable minimum wage (federal, state, or local).

### 2.2 Overtime

Under the FLSA, non-exempt employees must be paid at 1.5x their regular rate of pay for hours worked over 40 in a workweek.

**Exemptions from overtime** (the "white collar" exemptions):
- Employees must be paid on a salary basis at not less than $684 per week (as of 2024 federal threshold)
- AND must primarily perform exempt duties: executive, administrative, professional, outside sales, or computer professional duties

**Salary basis test**: An exempt employee must regularly receive a predetermined salary that is not subject to reduction based on quality or quantity of work (with limited exceptions).

### 2.3 Pay Frequency and Final Pay

State law governs pay frequency requirements. Final paycheck timing requirements vary significantly:
- Some states require final pay on the last day of employment (termination)
- Others allow the next regular pay date
- Accrued vacation payout on termination is required in some states (e.g., California) but not others

## Part 3: Non-Compete and Restrictive Covenants

### 3.1 Non-Compete Agreements

Non-compete agreements restrict an employee from working for competitors or starting a competing business for a specified period after employment ends. Enforceability varies dramatically by state:

- **Broadly enforceable** (with reasonable scope): Most states
- **Effectively unenforceable**: California, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Minnesota (recent ban)
- **Limited enforceability**: Colorado, Massachusetts, Illinois — require consideration, income thresholds, or advance notice

**Reasonableness factors** (for states that enforce non-competes):
- **Duration**: Typically 6 months to 2 years; courts are skeptical of terms exceeding 2 years
- **Geographic scope**: Must align with the employee's actual market/territory
- **Scope of restricted activities**: Must be limited to genuinely competitive activities
- **Consideration**: Most states require independent consideration beyond at-will employment for mid-employment non-competes

### 3.2 Non-Solicitation Agreements

Non-solicitation agreements restrict an employee from soliciting the employer's customers or employees after departure. These are generally more enforceable than non-competes and may be enforceable even in states that ban non-competes.

**California note**: Under Edwards v. Arthur Andersen (2008), non-solicitation agreements in California are subject to the same general prohibition as non-competes, though the law has evolved.

### 3.3 FTC Rule on Non-Competes (2024 Status)

In April 2024, the FTC issued a final rule broadly banning non-compete agreements. As of early 2026, the rule is subject to ongoing litigation. Employment counsel should be consulted for current enforceability status.

## Part 4: Confidentiality and Trade Secrets

### 4.1 Employee Confidentiality Obligations

Employees have common law and statutory obligations to protect employer confidential information and trade secrets, regardless of whether they signed a confidentiality agreement. Employment agreements typically include express confidentiality provisions to:
- Define what constitutes confidential information
- Clarify obligations during and after employment
- Establish remedies for breach

### 4.2 Defend Trade Secrets Act (DTSA)

The DTSA (18 U.S.C. § 1836 et seq.) provides a federal civil cause of action for trade secret misappropriation. Key provisions:
- Employers must include immunity notice in NDAs or confidentiality agreements
- The immunity notice states that individuals are immune from liability for confidential disclosure to a government official or attorney for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law

**Immunity notice requirement**: Failure to include the notice limits the employer's recovery to injunctive relief and actual damages (no exemplary damages or attorney's fees).

## Part 5: Intellectual Property in Employment

### 5.1 Work Made for Hire

Under the Copyright Act, copyrightable works created by employees within the scope of employment are "works made for hire" — meaning the employer owns the copyright automatically. For independent contractors, a written work-for-hire agreement must designate the work as a work for hire in one of the nine categories specified by the Act.

### 5.2 Invention Assignment

Most technology and professional services employers require employees to assign to the employer all inventions developed during employment that relate to the employer's business or result from employer resources.

**State law limitations on invention assignment** (the "moonlighting protection" statutes):
Several states protect employees' rights to retain inventions developed entirely on their own time, without employer resources, and unrelated to the employer's business:
- California (Labor Code § 2870)
- Delaware (Title 19, § 805)
- Illinois (765 ILCS 1060/2)
- Minnesota, North Carolina, Washington

Employment agreements must include notice of these limitations in covered states.

### 5.3 Prior IP and Exclusions

Employees sometimes seek to exclude pre-existing inventions (developed before employment) from the scope of IP assignment. Agreements should provide a schedule for listing excluded prior inventions. Failure to list inventions on the schedule may result in inadvertent assignment.

## Part 6: Leave and Benefits

### 6.1 Federal Leave Laws

- **FMLA** (Family and Medical Leave Act): Employers with 50+ employees must provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave per year for qualifying family and medical reasons. Employees must have 12 months of service and 1,250 hours worked.
- **ADA** (Americans with Disabilities Act): Employers with 15+ employees must provide reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities, which may include leave as an accommodation.
- **USERRA** (Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act): Protects employment rights of employees who leave for military service.

### 6.2 State Paid Leave Programs

Many states have enacted paid family and medical leave programs (California, New York, New Jersey, Washington, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Oregon, Colorado, and others). Programs vary in benefit duration, funding, and eligibility.

## Part 7: Termination and Separation

### 7.1 WARN Act (Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act)

The federal WARN Act requires employers with 100+ employees to provide 60 days' advance written notice of:
- **Plant closings**: Shutdown of a single employment site affecting 50+ employees
- **Mass layoffs**: Reduction affecting 500+ employees, or 50–499 employees representing at least 33% of the workforce at a single site

**Exceptions**: Faltering company, unforeseeable business circumstances, natural disaster

**Remedy for WARN violation**: Back pay and benefits for each day of the violation period (up to 60 days) plus civil penalties.

Many states have "mini-WARN" statutes with lower thresholds or longer notice periods.

### 7.2 Separation Agreements and Releases

Separation agreements typically include:
- A release of all employment-related claims
- Continued confidentiality and non-disparagement obligations
- Cooperation with future legal proceedings
- Return of company property

**Age discrimination considerations**: The Older Workers Benefit Protection Act (OWBPA) imposes specific requirements for a valid release of ADEA claims:
- Must be in writing and understandable
- Must specifically reference ADEA claims
- Must not waive future rights
- Must advise employee to consult with an attorney
- Must provide 21 days (45 days for group layoffs) to consider
- Must allow 7 days to revoke after signing
