## Overview

This reference document covers standard clauses, common variations, and key negotiation points in commercial lease agreements. It is intended to support AI-assisted review of office, retail, industrial, and other commercial leases. Residential leases are addressed only where standards differ materially from commercial practice.

---

## Part 1: Core Economic Terms

### 1.1 Base Rent

Base rent is the fixed periodic payment owed by the tenant to the landlord. It is typically stated as an annual rate per square foot (e.g., $45.00 per rentable square foot per year) or as a monthly dollar amount.

**Key considerations**:
- **Rentable vs. usable square footage**: Rentable square footage includes a proportionate share of common areas (the "load factor" or "loss factor"). Load factors of 10–20% are common in office buildings. Tenants should verify the rentable square footage measurement methodology (BOMA standards are the most widely used).
- **Pre-rent period**: Tenants often negotiate a rent-free period at the commencement of the lease to account for build-out time or as a concession.
- **Rent commencement date**: The date rent obligations begin, which may differ from the lease commencement date if a rent-free period applies.

### 1.2 Rent Escalation

Most commercial leases include annual rent increases to account for inflation and market appreciation. Common escalation structures include:

- **Fixed percentage increases**: A set annual percentage increase (e.g., 3% per year).
- **CPI-based increases**: Rent increases tied to the Consumer Price Index (typically All Urban Consumers, All Items), sometimes with a cap (floor: 0%, ceiling: 5%) to limit volatility.
- **Fair market rent resets**: At specified intervals (often at renewal), rent is reset to fair market value, subject to negotiation or appraisal.

**Review focus**: Confirm the escalation base, frequency, cap, and whether increases are compounding or simple.

### 1.3 Operating Expenses (Common Area Maintenance)

In a gross lease, the landlord pays all operating expenses. In a net lease, the tenant pays some or all operating expenses in addition to base rent. Operating expense structures include:

- **Net lease (single net)**: Tenant pays property taxes only.
- **Double net (NN)**: Tenant pays property taxes and building insurance.
- **Triple net (NNN)**: Tenant pays property taxes, insurance, and maintenance/operating expenses.
- **Modified gross**: Tenant pays base rent plus specified operating expenses, with the landlord responsible for the remainder.
- **Full-service gross**: Landlord pays all operating expenses; tenant pays base rent only (common in multi-tenant office buildings).

**Key operating expense issues**:
- **Controllable vs. uncontrollable expenses**: Tenants should seek caps on controllable operating expenses (management fees, maintenance, administrative costs) while accepting uncapped pass-through of uncontrollable expenses (taxes, insurance, utilities for common areas).
- **Exclusions from operating expenses**: Capital expenditures, depreciation, landlord-specific expenses, leasing commissions, and legal costs related to other tenants should be excluded.
- **Base year**: Some leases provide that the tenant pays only operating expenses above a "base year" amount, limiting exposure to expense increases.
- **Audit rights**: Tenants should have the right to audit operating expense reconciliations, typically within 12 months of receiving the annual statement.

## Part 2: Premises and Permitted Use

### 2.1 Premises Definition

The lease should precisely define the leased premises — including the suite or unit number, floor, and building. Any area excluded from the premises (e.g., dedicated storage, mechanical rooms) should be specified.

### 2.2 Permitted Use

The permitted use provision defines the activities the tenant may conduct on the premises. Landlords prefer narrow use clauses to maintain control over the building's character and avoid conflicts with other tenants. Tenants prefer broad use provisions to retain operational flexibility.

**Review focus**:
- Is the permitted use broad enough to accommodate the tenant's actual operations and reasonably anticipated changes?
- Does the clause include a catchall phrase such as "and any other lawful use"?
- Are there use restrictions imposed by other tenants' exclusive use rights?

### 2.3 Exclusive Use Rights

Tenants in retail and mixed-use properties often negotiate exclusive use rights that prevent the landlord from leasing other spaces to direct competitors. Exclusives should be specific, time-limited, and include a defined remedy (typically rent reduction or termination right) if violated.

## Part 3: Term and Options

### 3.1 Lease Term

The lease term defines the period during which the lease is in effect. Commercial leases typically range from 3 to 10 years for office and retail, and longer for industrial or built-to-suit properties.

**Key dates**:
- **Commencement date**: When the lease term begins. May be a fixed date or a date determined by a formula (e.g., date of substantial completion of tenant improvements + 30 days).
- **Expiration date**: When the lease term ends.
- **Option exercise deadline**: The deadline by which the tenant must exercise renewal or expansion options.

### 3.2 Renewal Options

Renewal options give the tenant the right (but not the obligation) to extend the lease term. Key terms include:
- **Number and duration of options**: How many renewal periods and how long each one is.
- **Rent during renewal**: Market rate (most common), fixed increase from expiring term, or CPI-adjusted.
- **Exercise notice period**: The window during which the tenant must exercise the option (typically 9–18 months before expiration).
- **Conditions for exercise**: Options are typically conditioned on the tenant not being in default and being in occupancy at the time of exercise.

### 3.3 Expansion Options

Expansion options give the tenant the right of first refusal or right of first offer on adjacent space. These provisions must specify:
- The space subject to the option
- The terms on which the tenant may lease the space (market rate, existing terms)
- The response period after notice from the landlord

### 3.4 Termination Options

Early termination options allow the tenant to terminate the lease before expiration, typically subject to a termination fee (commonly the unamortized cost of landlord-funded tenant improvements plus a payment representing a portion of remaining rent).

## Part 4: Tenant Improvements and Alterations

### 4.1 Tenant Improvement Allowance

The landlord may provide a tenant improvement (TI) allowance — a fixed dollar amount per square foot for the tenant to use toward fit-out of the premises. Key terms:
- **Allowance amount**: Typically stated as a dollar per square foot of rentable area.
- **Application deadline**: The period during which the TI allowance can be drawn (typically during construction, with a hard deadline).
- **Ownership of improvements**: Improvements generally become the landlord's property unless the lease provides otherwise.

### 4.2 Alterations and Improvements After Commencement

After taking occupancy, a tenant's right to make alterations is typically subject to landlord consent. Leases commonly distinguish between:
- **Non-structural alterations below a dollar threshold**: Permitted without landlord approval.
- **Structural alterations or alterations above the threshold**: Require written consent.

**Restoration obligations**: Landlords may require restoration of alterations at lease expiration. Tenants should seek upfront designation of which alterations must be removed to avoid uncertainty at end of term.

## Part 5: Assignment and Subletting

### 5.1 Assignment

Assignment involves a transfer of the tenant's entire interest in the lease to a third party. Landlords typically require consent for assignment, which may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed (a "reasonableness" standard). Landlords may recapture the space instead of consenting.

**Permitted assignments** (generally allowed without consent):
- Assignments to affiliates or subsidiaries
- Assignments in connection with a corporate reorganization
- Assignments in connection with a merger, acquisition, or change of control

### 5.2 Subletting

Subletting involves the tenant's lease of a portion or all of the premises to a subtenant while the tenant retains its obligations under the head lease. The head tenant remains liable to the landlord; the subtenant is liable only to the head tenant.

---

## Part 6: Insurance and Indemnification

### 6.1 Tenant Insurance Requirements

Leases typically require tenants to maintain:
- **Commercial General Liability (CGL)**: Minimum limits of $1M per occurrence / $2M aggregate (higher limits for retail or high-foot-traffic locations)
- **Property insurance**: For tenant's personal property and any alterations
- **Workers' compensation**: As required by law
- **Business interruption**: Optional but advisable
- **Umbrella/excess liability**: As specified in the lease

Tenants must typically name the landlord as an additional insured and provide certificates of insurance annually.

### 6.2 Mutual Waiver of Subrogation

Standard leases include a mutual waiver of subrogation, preventing each party's insurer from pursuing a claim against the other party after paying an insured loss. This provision protects against inadvertent insurance-funded litigation between landlord and tenant.

### 6.3 Indemnification

Leases contain reciprocal indemnification provisions, though the scope varies. Tenants generally indemnify landlords for claims arising from the tenant's use of the premises or negligence; landlords indemnify tenants for claims arising from the landlord's negligence or breach.

## Part 7: Default and Remedies

### 7.1 Events of Tenant Default

Common events of tenant default include:
- Failure to pay rent within a grace period (typically 3–5 days after written notice)
- Failure to perform non-monetary obligations within a cure period (typically 30 days after written notice, with extension for defaults not curable within 30 days)
- Bankruptcy or insolvency
- Abandonment of the premises
- Unauthorized assignment or subletting

### 7.2 Landlord Remedies

Upon tenant default, the landlord may:
- **Terminate the lease** and recover damages (often the present value of remaining rent minus the fair market rental value)
- **Re-enter and re-let**: Take possession and re-lease the premises, holding the tenant liable for the shortfall
- **Pursue the guaranty**: If a guaranty was provided, pursue the guarantor for obligations

### 7.3 Landlord Default

Landlord defaults are less commonly addressed in standard lease forms but include failure to provide utilities, maintain common areas, or comply with applicable law. Tenants should negotiate self-help rights (the right to remedy a landlord default and offset costs against rent after proper notice) for critical obligations.

---

## Part 8: Holdover

### 8.1 Holdover Provisions

If a tenant remains in the premises after lease expiration without a renewal or extension, it is a "holdover tenant." Holdover provisions typically provide:
- The holdover creates a month-to-month tenancy
- Holdover rent is 125–150% of the base rent at expiration
- The landlord may accept holdover rent without creating a new long-term tenancy
