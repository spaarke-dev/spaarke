## Overview

This glossary defines standard contract terminology used across commercial agreements, service contracts, licensing arrangements, and vendor relationships. These definitions reflect common usage in US commercial contract practice and are intended to support AI-assisted document review by providing definitional context when interpreting contract language.

---

## A

**Acceptance**
The act by which a party signals agreement to an offer, forming a binding contract. Acceptance must generally mirror the terms of the offer (the "mirror image" rule). In commercial contracts, acceptance often occurs by signature, conduct, or payment.

**Amendment**
A formal modification to an existing contract that changes one or more of its provisions. Amendments must generally be in writing and signed by both parties to be enforceable. An amendment is distinguishable from a waiver in that it permanently alters the contract terms rather than excusing a single instance of non-performance.

**Arbitration**
A form of alternative dispute resolution in which a neutral third party (the arbitrator) hears evidence and renders a binding decision. Arbitration clauses specify the governing rules (e.g., AAA, JAMS, ICC), the seat of arbitration, the number of arbitrators, and confidentiality requirements.

**Assignment**
The transfer of rights or obligations under a contract to a third party. Most commercial contracts restrict or prohibit assignment without prior written consent. Anti-assignment clauses often carve out assignments to affiliates or in connection with a change of control.

**At-Will**
A relationship or provision that can be terminated by either party at any time without cause. Employment relationships in most US states are at-will. Some service contracts include at-will termination rights for convenience (as opposed to only for cause).

---

## B

**Breach**
A failure to perform a contractual obligation without legal excuse. Breach may be material (going to the heart of the agreement) or minor (a less significant failure). A material breach typically allows the non-breaching party to terminate the contract and sue for damages. A minor breach may entitle the non-breaching party to damages only.

**Business Day**
Typically defined as a day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or recognized federal or state holiday. Contracts should specify the jurisdiction's holiday calendar if the definition matters for notice deadlines or performance periods.

---

## C

**Cap on Liability**
A contractual ceiling on the total amount one party can recover from the other in the event of breach, indemnification, or other liability-triggering events. Caps are commonly expressed as a multiple of fees paid in the prior 12-month period or as a fixed dollar amount. Certain categories of damages — such as fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct — are frequently excluded from caps.

**Change Order**
A formal document modifying the scope, schedule, or price of a project or statement of work. Change orders must typically be signed by authorized representatives of both parties before work commences.

**Confidential Information**
Information disclosed by one party to another that is designated as confidential or should reasonably be understood to be confidential given its nature. Definitions vary widely; some contracts use broad catch-all definitions while others limit confidentiality to specifically marked materials.

**Consequential Damages**
Indirect losses that flow from a breach but are not the direct result of the breach itself — such as lost profits, loss of business opportunity, or reputational harm. Most commercial contracts include mutual exclusions of consequential damages. Exceptions are typically carved out for breaches of confidentiality, IP indemnification, or willful misconduct.

**Counterparts**
A provision allowing a contract to be executed in multiple copies, each of which is considered an original. Electronic signatures and PDF execution are commonly addressed in conjunction with counterpart provisions.

**Cure Period**
The time allowed to a breaching party to remedy a breach after receiving written notice. Typical cure periods range from 10 to 30 days. Cure periods may be extended for breaches that cannot reasonably be cured within the standard period.

---

## D

**Default**
A triggering event that gives rise to rights under a contract — typically the right to terminate or accelerate obligations. Defaults may be events of default (specific listed events) or cross-defaults (default under one agreement triggers default under another).

**Deliverable**
A specific, tangible output required under a statement of work or project agreement — such as a software module, report, design specification, or trained model. Deliverables should have defined acceptance criteria and deadlines.

**Dispute Resolution**
The contractual mechanism for resolving disagreements between the parties. Dispute resolution clauses may specify a tiered process: negotiation, then mediation, then arbitration or litigation.

**Due Diligence**
The investigative process of reviewing a target's legal, financial, operational, and technical records before completing a transaction. In contract contexts, due diligence obligations may require a party to verify representations made by the other.

---

## E

**Effective Date**
The date on which a contract and its obligations take effect. The effective date may differ from the execution date if the parties intend retroactive effect or delayed commencement.

**Entire Agreement**
An "integration clause" providing that the written contract represents the complete and final agreement of the parties, superseding all prior negotiations, representations, and agreements. Entire agreement clauses prevent parties from introducing extrinsic evidence of pre-contract understandings.

**Escrow**
The holding of assets — money, software source code, or documents — by a neutral third party pending satisfaction of specified conditions. Software escrow arrangements provide licensees with access to source code if a licensor becomes insolvent or fails to maintain the software.

**Exclusivity**
A provision restricting one or both parties from dealing with competitors of the other during the contract term. Exclusivity provisions must be carefully scoped for duration, geography, and product/service category to avoid antitrust concerns.

---

## F

**Force Majeure**
A clause excusing non-performance of contractual obligations due to unforeseeable circumstances beyond a party's reasonable control — such as natural disasters, acts of war, government orders, or pandemics. Force majeure provisions typically specify triggering events, notice requirements, and the effect on obligations (suspension vs. termination).

**Fraud**
Intentional misrepresentation or concealment of material facts to induce another party to enter a contract. Fraud claims are typically carved out from liability caps, indemnification limitations, and other contractual limitations on recovery.

---

## G

**Governing Law**
The jurisdiction whose laws will be applied to interpret and enforce the contract. Choice-of-law provisions typically specify a state (e.g., "the laws of the State of Delaware") and may specify whether conflict-of-law rules are excluded.

**Good Faith**
The implied obligation in all contracts (under the UCC and common law in most states) to act honestly and in accordance with reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing. Good faith does not override express contractual rights but can affect how those rights are exercised.

---

## I

**Indemnification**
An obligation by one party to hold the other harmless from specified losses, claims, or liabilities. Indemnification provisions specify the triggering events, the scope of covered losses, the procedural requirements (notice, control of defense), and any caps or exclusions.

**Intellectual Property**
Creations of the mind protected by law — including patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets. IP provisions in contracts address ownership of pre-existing IP, ownership of work product created under the contract, licenses granted, and IP indemnification.

---

## L

**Limitation of Liability**
A provision capping the maximum recovery available to a party for claims arising under the contract. Limitations of liability often work in conjunction with mutual exclusions of consequential damages and indemnification caps.

**Liquidated Damages**
Pre-agreed damages specified in the contract for a particular type of breach, used when actual damages would be difficult to calculate. Liquidated damages clauses must represent a reasonable estimate of anticipated loss to be enforceable (they cannot be penalties).

---

## M

**Material Adverse Change (MAC)**
A change that substantially affects the business, financial condition, or operations of a party. MAC clauses in acquisition agreements allow a buyer to walk away if a MAC occurs between signing and closing. The definition of what constitutes a MAC is heavily negotiated.

**Milestone**
A specific point in a project timeline at which a defined output or achievement is required. Milestones may be tied to payment, acceptance testing, or the right to proceed to the next phase.

---

## N

**Non-Solicitation**
A provision restricting a party from soliciting the other's employees, customers, or vendors during and after the contract term. Non-solicitation clauses must be reasonable in scope to be enforceable.

**Notice**
Formal written communication required by contract for specific events — such as breach, termination, change orders, or claims. Notice provisions specify the required method (e.g., certified mail, overnight courier, email), the recipient, and when notice is deemed received.

---

## R

**Representations and Warranties**
Factual statements made by a party at the time of contracting. Representations induce a party to enter the contract; warranties are enforceable promises about current or future facts. Breach of a representation or warranty may give rise to claims for rescission or damages.

**Renewal**
The continuation of a contract beyond its initial term. Automatic renewal provisions require parties to give notice of non-renewal within a specified window or the contract renews for an additional period.

---

## S

**Severability**
A provision stating that if any portion of the contract is found unenforceable, the remainder continues in full force. Severability clauses prevent wholesale invalidity of a contract due to a single unenforceable provision.

**Specific Performance**
An equitable remedy requiring a breaching party to perform a specific contractual obligation rather than pay damages. Specific performance is typically available only where monetary damages would be inadequate — as in contracts for unique goods or real property.

**Subcontractor**
A party engaged by the prime contractor to perform a portion of the work under the prime contract. Subcontracting provisions address whether consent is required, whether the prime contractor remains liable for subcontractor performance, and how subcontractors flow down prime contract obligations.

---

## T

**Term**
The duration of the contract — from the effective date to the expiration or termination date. Term provisions may include automatic renewal, options to extend, and conditions for early termination.

**Termination for Cause**
The right to end a contract due to the other party's material breach or specified default. Termination for cause typically requires notice and an opportunity to cure before termination becomes effective.

**Termination for Convenience**
The right to end a contract without cause, typically upon advance written notice (commonly 30–90 days). Termination-for-convenience provisions may require payment for work performed through the termination date plus wind-down costs.

---

## W

**Warranty**
A contractual promise about the quality, condition, or performance of goods or services. Express warranties are stated explicitly; implied warranties (such as the implied warranty of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose under the UCC) arise by operation of law and are commonly disclaimed in commercial contracts.

**Waiver**
The voluntary relinquishment of a known contractual right. Most contracts include non-waiver clauses stating that failure to enforce a provision does not constitute a waiver of the right to enforce it in the future.
