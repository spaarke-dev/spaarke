## Overview

This checklist covers the 20 key elements that should be examined when reviewing a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) or Confidentiality Agreement (CA). NDAs vary significantly in their protectiveness, scope, and reciprocity. This reference is designed to support systematic review of NDA documents, flag common issues, and guide analysis output when evaluating confidentiality arrangements.

---

## Part 1: Identification and Parties

### Item 1: Party Identification

Verify that all parties are correctly and fully identified. Each party should be described with its full legal name, state or jurisdiction of formation, and type of legal entity (corporation, LLC, partnership, etc.). Misidentification of a party can affect enforceability and the ability to bring claims.

**Review questions**:
- Are the full legal names (not trade names or abbreviations) used throughout?
- Is the jurisdiction of formation stated for each entity?
- Are any affiliates or subsidiaries included as parties or separately addressed?

### Item 2: Recitals and Purpose

The recitals (or "background" section) should clearly state the purpose for which confidential information is being shared. The purpose statement limits the permitted use of disclosed information. An overly broad or vague purpose may inadvertently permit uses the disclosing party did not intend.

**Review questions**:
- Is the purpose clearly defined and appropriately narrow?
- Does the purpose align with the actual business relationship?
- Is the purpose stated in a way that could be expanded by the receiving party?

---

## Part 2: Definition of Confidential Information

### Item 3: Scope of Definition

The definition of "Confidential Information" is one of the most negotiated provisions of an NDA. Definitions range from narrow (requiring written marking) to broad (covering all information exchanged, whether oral or written).

**Common definition structures**:
- **Marked**: Only information specifically labeled "Confidential" qualifies.
- **Category-based**: Specific categories of information are deemed confidential per se (financial data, technical specifications, personnel information, etc.).
- **Broad catch-all**: All information disclosed in connection with the relationship is confidential, regardless of marking.

**Review questions**:
- Is the definition broad enough to protect the disclosing party's actual information?
- Does the definition require marking or labeling that could be impractical?
- Are oral disclosures covered, and if so, is there a confirmation procedure (e.g., follow-up written summary within 5 business days)?

### Item 4: Excluded Information

Standard NDA exclusions allow the receiving party to use information that:
1. Is or becomes publicly available through no fault of the receiving party
2. Was rightfully known to the receiving party before disclosure
3. Is independently developed by the receiving party without use of the confidential information
4. Is received from a third party who is not under a confidentiality obligation

**Review questions**:
- Are the standard exclusions present and properly scoped?
- Is the burden of proof for exclusions placed on the receiving party (standard) or the disclosing party?
- Does the agreement address information that is only partially in the public domain?

---

## Part 3: Obligations and Permitted Use

### Item 5: Standard of Care

The receiving party's obligation is typically to protect confidential information with the same degree of care it uses to protect its own confidential information, but not less than a reasonable standard of care.

**Review questions**:
- Is the standard of care expressly defined?
- Is the standard "reasonable care" or a heightened standard (e.g., "industry best practices")?
- Are specific security measures required (encryption, access controls, etc.)?

### Item 6: Permitted Use Limitation

The receiving party may use confidential information only for the stated purpose. Any use outside the permitted purpose is a breach.

**Review questions**:
- Is the permitted use clearly limited to the stated purpose?
- Are internal sharing restrictions addressed (e.g., need-to-know basis)?
- Are there provisions addressing what happens if the purpose expands?

### Item 7: Permitted Disclosure to Representatives

Most NDAs permit disclosure to employees, officers, directors, and professional advisors who need to know the information and are bound by equivalent confidentiality obligations.

**Review questions**:
- Is the category of permitted recipients clearly defined?
- Is the receiving party responsible for representatives' compliance?
- Are third-party contractors or subcontractors addressed?

### Item 8: Required Disclosures

Parties may be required to disclose confidential information pursuant to legal process (subpoena, court order, regulatory inquiry). Agreements typically require the receiving party to:
1. Promptly notify the disclosing party
2. Cooperate with the disclosing party's efforts to seek a protective order
3. Disclose only the minimum information required

**Review questions**:
- Is a notification obligation expressly required (and is prior notification required if feasible)?
- Is there a cooperation obligation?
- Does the exception adequately protect both parties?

---

## Part 4: Term and Survival

### Item 9: Term of Agreement

The NDA should specify:
- The date the agreement becomes effective
- How long the agreement remains in force

**Review questions**:
- Is the term clearly stated?
- Does the term align with the anticipated duration of the business relationship?

### Item 10: Survival of Obligations

Confidentiality obligations frequently survive expiration or termination of the NDA for a specified additional period. Typical survival periods range from 2 to 5 years. Trade secrets may be protected indefinitely under applicable law regardless of contractual survival periods.

**Review questions**:
- What is the survival period after termination or expiration?
- Is the survival period adequate for the sensitivity of the information?
- Are trade secrets addressed separately with indefinite protection?
- Does the agreement survive a change of control?

---

## Part 5: Return and Destruction

### Item 11: Return or Destruction of Information

Upon termination of the agreement or at the disclosing party's request, the receiving party is typically required to return or certify destruction of all confidential information and copies.

**Review questions**:
- Is there an obligation to return or destroy upon request or termination?
- Is a written certification of destruction required?
- Are backup copies, archived systems, or legal hold materials addressed?
- How long does the receiving party have to complete return or destruction?

---

## Part 6: Remedies and Enforcement

### Item 12: Injunctive Relief

Breaches of confidentiality are notoriously difficult to remedy with money damages because the harm is often irreparable. NDA agreements typically include a provision confirming that the disclosing party is entitled to seek injunctive or other equitable relief without posting a bond.

**Review questions**:
- Is a right to seek injunctive relief expressly stated?
- Is the bond/security waiver included?
- Is the acknowledgment of irreparable harm mutual or one-sided?

### Item 13: Limitations on Damages

Some NDAs include limitations on liability or exclusions of consequential damages. Disclosing parties should be wary of such limitations, as actual damages from a confidentiality breach may be difficult to quantify and consequential damages may be the primary recoverable harm.

**Review questions**:
- Are there any caps on damages or exclusions of consequential damages?
- Are carve-outs appropriate (e.g., no cap for willful breach)?
- Is the limitation mutual or one-sided?

---

## Part 7: Intellectual Property and Ownership

### Item 14: No License

NDAs should include an express statement that no license or other right in the confidential information is granted by disclosure. Without this clause, disclosure could arguably create an implied license.

**Review questions**:
- Is a "no license" provision expressly stated?
- Does the provision address all forms of IP (patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks)?
- Is residuals language present, and if so, is it appropriately limited?

### Item 15: Residuals

Some NDAs — particularly those favoring technology companies — include a "residuals" clause allowing the receiving party to use general ideas, concepts, or know-how retained in the unaided memory of individuals who had access to confidential information. Residuals clauses can significantly undermine protections for trade secrets.

**Review questions**:
- Is a residuals clause present?
- Is the scope of residuals appropriately limited (unaided memory only, no intentional memorization)?
- Should the residuals clause be resisted or eliminated?

---

## Part 8: Reciprocity and Relationship

### Item 16: Mutual vs. One-Way

NDAs may be mutual (both parties disclose and receive confidential information) or one-way (only one party discloses). Mutual agreements impose identical obligations on both parties.

**Review questions**:
- Is the agreement appropriately mutual or one-way given the parties' roles?
- If mutual, are the obligations symmetric?
- Does a one-way structure fairly reflect the actual disclosure pattern?

### Item 17: Non-Solicitation of Personnel

Some NDAs include non-solicitation provisions restricting a party from recruiting or hiring the other party's employees during and after the NDA term. These provisions are separate from confidentiality and have independent enforceability requirements.

**Review questions**:
- Is a non-solicitation provision present?
- Is the restriction reasonable in duration and scope?
- Does it cover only direct solicitation or also general job postings?

### Item 18: Relationship Disclaimer

NDAs frequently disclaim that the agreement creates a partnership, joint venture, agency, or other relationship. This prevents a party from asserting that it has broader authority to act on behalf of the other.

**Review questions**:
- Is a relationship disclaimer present?
- Does it adequately address the specific risks of the relationship?

---

## Part 9: Governing Law and Dispute Resolution

### Item 19: Governing Law and Jurisdiction

**Review questions**:
- Is the governing law specified?
- Is the jurisdiction for disputes specified (and is it exclusive)?
- Is the governing law consistent with the parties' locations and the type of relationship?

### Item 20: General Provisions

Verify the following standard boilerplate provisions:
- **Entire Agreement**: Supersedes all prior discussions about confidentiality
- **Amendment**: Must be in writing and signed
- **Waiver**: Failure to enforce is not a waiver
- **Severability**: Invalid provisions do not invalidate the whole agreement
- **Counterparts and Electronic Signatures**: Agreement may be executed electronically

**Review questions**:
- Are all standard boilerplate provisions present?
- Is there an attorney's fees provision and, if so, is it mutual?
- Is notice adequately addressed for breach notification purposes?

## Summary Risk Assessment

| Risk Area | Key Questions | Red Flags |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| Definition Scope | Is confidential information broadly enough defined? | Marking-only requirement; oral disclosures not covered |
| Survival Period | Does survival outlast the sensitivity of the information? | Short survival (< 2 years) for highly sensitive data |
| Exclusions | Are standard exclusions present and properly scoped? | Missing burden of proof; poorly defined public domain carve-out |
| Remedies | Is injunctive relief available? | Consequential damages excluded without carve-out |
| Residuals | Is a residuals clause present? | Broad residuals language that undermines trade secret protection |
| Ownership | Is a no-license provision present? | Absence of no-license clause; implied license risk |
| Non-Solicitation | Is the restriction reasonable? | Duration > 2 years; covers general job postings |
