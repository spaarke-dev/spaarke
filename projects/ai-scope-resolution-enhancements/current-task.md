## Quick Recovery

**If resuming after compaction:**

1. **Check task status**: Look at "Active Task" section above
2. **Load context**:
   - Read project CLAUDE.md for ADRs and patterns
   - Check TASK-INDEX.md for overall progress
3. **Continue from checkpoint**: Use "Completed Steps" to know where you are
4. **Say**: "continue" or "resume task {id}" to pick up

**If starting fresh:**

Say: "work on task 001" to begin Phase 0
