Define specific risk indicators (not vague \"look for problems\")\n2. Provide severity classification criteria\n3. Request structured output with risk fields\n4. Include confidence scoring for each finding\n5. Request supporting evidence/quotes from document\n\n### Example Risk Output Schema\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risks\": [\n    {\n      \"category\": \"Financial\",\n      \"severity\": \"HIGH\",\n      \"description\": \"Unlimited liability provision\",\n      \"evidence\": \"Section 8.2 states...\",\n      \"recommendation\": \"Negotiate liability cap\",\n      \"likelihood\": 4,\n      \"impact\": 5,\n      \"score\": 20\n    }\n  ],\n  \"overallRiskLevel\": \"HIGH\",\n  \"requiresEscalation\": true,\n  \"escalationReason\": \"Critical financial exposure\"\n}\n```\n\n### Escalation Patterns\n\n- Auto-escalate CRITICAL risks to designated reviewer\n- Batch HIGH risks for daily review\n- Log MEDIUM risks for trending analysis\n- Include escalation reason and recommended action",
