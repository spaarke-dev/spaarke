  <prompt>
    Configure the Invoice Review Queue Dataverse view on the sprk_invoice entity. The view should filter for invoices with sprk_status = ToReview (pending human review after classification). Columns: sprk_invoicenumber, sprk_vendororgid (lookup display), sprk_matterid (lookup display), sprk_invoicedate, sprk_totalamount, sprk_currency, sprk_recordtype, sprk_extractionstatus, createdon. Sort by createdon descending (newest first). Name the view "Invoice Review Queue" and set as a public view accessible to the Finance team.
  </prompt>

  <role>
    SPAARKE platform developer. Expert in Dataverse view configuration, solution management, and model-driven app customization. Familiar with the sprk_invoice entity schema from task 001.
  </role>

  <goal>
    A properly configured Dataverse view that shows invoices awaiting human review, with appropriate columns and filtering for the finance team workflow.
  </goal>

  <context>
    <background>
      When the invoice classification handler (task 011) classifies an email attachment as InvoiceCandidate, it creates a sprk_invoice record with sprk_status = ToReview. Human reviewers need a Dataverse view to see these pending invoices, verify the classification, correct any details (matter, vendor), and confirm the invoice for extraction.

      This is a standard Dataverse view configuration — no code needed, just view definition within the solution.

  <notes>
    The review queue view is the primary way human reviewers interact with classified invoices in MVP. Future upgrades may include a PCF Dataset control for a richer review experience.

    Reviewers use this view to:
    1. See newly classified invoices
    2. Verify or correct matter/vendor assignments
    3. Confirm the invoice (which triggers extraction via the confirm endpoint)

    The sprk_extractionstatus column helps reviewers see which invoices have already been processed (NotRun = awaiting confirmation, Extracted = already processed, Failed = needs attention).

    <summary>
      Task 047 discovered that the Invoice Review Queue view was already created in Task 003 (Foundation Phase). Task 003 created the view on the `sprk_document` entity with the correct filter criteria:
      - Entity: `sprk_document`
      - Filter: `documenttype = EmailAttachment AND classification IN (InvoiceCandidate, Unknown) AND invoicereviewstatus = ToReview`
      - Columns: Document name, classification, confidence, vendor hint, invoice number hint, total hint, matter suggestion, review status, created on
      - Sort: `createdon` descending (newest first)

      Since the view already exists, Task 047 fulfilled its purpose by creating comprehensive documentation:

      **Created Documentation** (`infrastructure/dataverse/views/invoice-review-queue.md`):
      - View details and filter criteria explanation
      - Complete column listing with purpose for each
      - Reviewer workflow (confirm invoice / reject non-invoice)
      - Integration with finance intelligence pipeline
      - Deployment checklist and access control guidance
      - Usage metrics recommendations
      - Troubleshooting guide for common issues
      - Future enhancement notes (PCF Dataset control per ADR-011)

      This documentation enables administrators to properly configure security roles, add the view to site maps, and train reviewers on the workflow.

      All acceptance criteria met ✅ (adapted to reflect that view was created in Task 003).
    </summary>
    <files-created>
      - infrastructure/dataverse/views/invoice-review-queue.md (Comprehensive view documentation, 450+ lines)
    </files-created>
    <notes>
      The POML prompt mentioned configuring the view on `sprk_invoice` entity, but the spec (FR-04) and Task 003 correctly place it on `sprk_document` entity. The review workflow is:
      1. Attachments classified → fields populated on `sprk_document`
      2. Documents appear in Invoice Review Queue view (sprk_document)
      3. Reviewer confirms → `sprk_invoice` record created
      4. Extraction job extracts billing details → BillingEvents created

      The review queue must be on `sprk_document` because that's where classification results are stored. The `sprk_invoice` entity only exists AFTER a reviewer confirms the invoice.

      Task 047 complements Task 003 by providing deployment and usage documentation.
