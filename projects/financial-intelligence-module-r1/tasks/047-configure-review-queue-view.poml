  <prompt>
    Configure the Invoice Review Queue Dataverse view on the sprk_invoice entity. The view should filter for invoices with sprk_status = ToReview (pending human review after classification). Columns: sprk_invoicenumber, sprk_vendororgid (lookup display), sprk_matterid (lookup display), sprk_invoicedate, sprk_totalamount, sprk_currency, sprk_recordtype, sprk_extractionstatus, createdon. Sort by createdon descending (newest first). Name the view "Invoice Review Queue" and set as a public view accessible to the Finance team.
  </prompt>

  <role>
    SPAARKE platform developer. Expert in Dataverse view configuration, solution management, and model-driven app customization. Familiar with the sprk_invoice entity schema from task 001.
  </role>

  <goal>
    A properly configured Dataverse view that shows invoices awaiting human review, with appropriate columns and filtering for the finance team workflow.
  </goal>

  <context>
    <background>
      When the invoice classification handler (task 011) classifies an email attachment as InvoiceCandidate, it creates a sprk_invoice record with sprk_status = ToReview. Human reviewers need a Dataverse view to see these pending invoices, verify the classification, correct any details (matter, vendor), and confirm the invoice for extraction.

      This is a standard Dataverse view configuration — no code needed, just view definition within the solution.

  <notes>
    The review queue view is the primary way human reviewers interact with classified invoices in MVP. Future upgrades may include a PCF Dataset control for a richer review experience.

    Reviewers use this view to:
    1. See newly classified invoices
    2. Verify or correct matter/vendor assignments
    3. Confirm the invoice (which triggers extraction via the confirm endpoint)

    The sprk_extractionstatus column helps reviewers see which invoices have already been processed (NotRun = awaiting confirmation, Extracted = already processed, Failed = needs attention).
