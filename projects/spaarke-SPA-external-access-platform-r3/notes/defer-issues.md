### ISS-001 — AuthorizationModule: Copilot audience merge and failure logging applied once per process, not per options instance

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Status** | Open |
| **Urgency** | next-round |
| **Filed** | 2026-10-10 |
| **Source** | R3 task 010; confirmed by both adversarial review passes |
| **GitHub Issue** | https://github.com/spaarke-dev/spaarke/issues/1623 |

**Description**

The default JwtBearer scheme's Copilot-audience merge and its `CopilotAuth` sign-in-failure logging run in a `PostConfigure` guarded by a static once-per-process flag (`_jwtPostConfigureApplied`), instead of once per options instance.

Any later `JwtBearerOptions("Bearer")` instance silently loses the Copilot audience (Copilot tokens then get 401) and the failure logging. Two ways to get a later instance:
- a second test host in the same process;
- an instance rebuilt after a configuration reload (`JwtBearerConfigureOptions` binds `IConfiguration` with a change token).

This is pre-existing and not caused by R3. R3's CIAM guard is a separate `PostConfigure` without the flag, so it is unaffected.

**Entry-points**

- `src/server/api/Sprk.Bff.Api/Infrastructure/DI/AuthorizationModule.cs:37` (the flag)
- `src/server/api/Sprk.Bff.Api/Infrastructure/DI/AuthorizationModule.cs:106-111` (the gated `PostConfigure`)
- `tests/unit/Sprk.Bff.Api.Tests/Infrastructure/DI/AuthorizationModuleCiamTests.cs` (the harness re-adds the Copilot audience to work around it)

**Suggested fix**

Make the merge idempotent per options instance, for example by checking whether the Copilot audience is already present. Then remove the test-harness workaround.

**Estimated effort**: 2–4 hours, including a test with two hosts in one process.
**Blockers**: none.
**Related**:
- `AuthorizationModule.cs` is shared with unified-access-control-r2.
- A candidate for the auth-system-of-record remediation phase.
- Not yet confirmed: whether a production reload actually rebuilds this instance.

### ISS-002 — ChatMessageStreamingContractTests mid-stream error test fails intermittently under full-suite load

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Status** | Open |
| **Urgency** | next-round |
| **Filed** | 2026-10-10 |
| **Source** | R3 task 031 full unit-suite run (19512 passed, 54 skipped, 1 failed) |
| **GitHub Issue** | https://github.com/spaarke-dev/spaarke/issues/1633 |

**Description**

`SendMessage_ModelThrowsAfterTwoTokens_EmitsTypingEndThenSafeErrorAndNothingAfter` failed once in a full `dotnet test tests/unit/Sprk.Bff.Api.Tests/` run on the R3 branch. It took 2 min 25 s under load and passes 6/6 alone. Task 031 does not touch AI chat code. A load-dependent contract-test failure fails CI at random. The failure message was not captured, so the cause is unconfirmed.

**Entry-points**

- `tests/integration/contract/Api/Ai/ChatMessageStreamingContractTests.cs:194`
- `dotnet test tests/unit/Sprk.Bff.Api.Tests/ --filter "FullyQualifiedName~ChatMessageStreamingContractTests"` (passes alone)

**Suggested fix**

Capture the failure with `--logger trx` on a full run. Then check for a fixed SSE read timeout, or shared `_fixture.ChatClient` scripting across parallel tests.

**Estimated effort**: 2–4 hours, mostly reproduction.
**Blockers**: none.
**Related**: AI chat area; not R3 scope.
