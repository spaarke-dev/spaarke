  <prompt>
    <role>
      You are a project engineer performing final project housekeeping. You update all project artifacts to reflect completion, document lessons learned, archive ephemeral notes, run the repo-cleanup skill to validate repository structure, and create the final commit ready for merge to master.
    </role>
    <goal>
      Complete the project wrap-up for AI Semantic Search UI R3. Update README.md status to "Complete", update all task statuses in TASK-INDEX.md, create lessons-learned.md in the project root, archive ephemeral notes/ files, run /repo-cleanup for structure validation, and create the final commit with a conventional commit message.
    </goal>
    <context>
      This is the final task of the project. All implementation, testing, deployment, and quality gate tasks are complete.

      Project artifacts to update:
        - projects/ai-semantic-search-ui-r3/README.md
          → Change status badge from "In Progress" to "Complete"
          → Check all acceptance criteria boxes in the README
          → Update "Last Updated" date to today (2026-02-24 or actual completion date)

        - projects/ai-semantic-search-ui-r3/tasks/TASK-INDEX.md
          → Verify all tasks show ✅ (completed) status
          → No tasks should remain as 🔲 (pending) or 🔄 (in progress)

        - projects/ai-semantic-search-ui-r3/current-task.md
          → Reset to "No active task" state
          → Clear the active task fields
          → Note project completion

      New artifact to create:
        - projects/ai-semantic-search-ui-r3/lessons-learned.md
          Sections:
            ## What Worked Well
              - Items that went smoothly (e.g., code page pattern reuse from DocRelViewer)
              - Tooling that proved effective
            ## What Could Be Improved
              - Friction points encountered during implementation
              - Processes that slowed delivery
            ## Technical Learnings
              - Key technical discoveries from the project
              - ADR interpretations clarified
              - Patterns that emerged
            ## Recommendations for Future Projects
              - Specific suggestions for subsequent projects
              - Template improvements
              - Tooling additions

      Ephemeral notes/ cleanup:
        - notes/drafts/ — can be archived (create notes/archive/ and move drafts there)
        - notes/spikes/ — can be archived (move to notes/archive/)
        - notes/debug/ — validation and deployment logs: move to notes/archive/
        - notes/archive/ stays in the project folder
        - Do NOT delete notes — only archive (move) them

      Repo cleanup:
        - Run /repo-cleanup skill to validate repository structure
        - Address any findings from repo-cleanup

      Final commit:
        - Stage all changed/new files from this project
        - Use conventional commit format: feat(ai-semantic-search-r3): complete R3 implementation
        - Include summary of changes in commit body
        - Use push-to-github skill for the final commit and PR
    </context>
    <constraints>
      - Do NOT delete any notes/ files — archive them to notes/archive/
      - Lessons-learned.md should be honest and specific — not generic platitudes
      - The final commit must include all project artifact updates (README, TASK-INDEX, current-task, lessons-learned)
      - Use push-to-github skill for the final push — do not push directly without the skill
      - The commit message must follow conventional commit format
    </constraints>
