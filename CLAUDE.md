## Development Environment

### Claude Code Extended Context Settings

This monorepo uses extended context settings for multi-phase feature development. These environment variables enable Claude Code to handle complex project pipelines with deep context requirements:

```bash
MAX_THINKING_TOKENS=50000
CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS=64000
```

**Why Extended Context?**
- **Multi-phase projects**: AI Document Intelligence R1 has 100+ tasks across 8 phases
- **Deep resource discovery**: Skills load ADRs, knowledge docs, patterns, and existing code
- **Context-rich task execution**: Each task includes full project history, applicable constraints
- **Pipeline orchestration**: project-pipeline skill chains multiple component skills

**When to Use**:
- Running `/project-pipeline` for new projects with extensive specs (>2000 words)
- Executing complex tasks that touch multiple system areas (API + PCF + Dataverse)
- Working on AI features that require ADR-013/014/015/016 context loading
- Phase wrap-up tasks that synthesize learnings across many prior tasks

**Setting in Windows**:
```cmd
setx MAX_THINKING_TOKENS "50000"
setx CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS "64000"
```

**Verifying settings**:
```powershell
# In new terminal session
echo $env:MAX_THINKING_TOKENS
echo $env:CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS
```

## 🚀 Project Initialization: Developer Workflow

**Standard 2-Step Process for New Projects:**

### Step 1: Create AI-Optimized Specification

**If you have a human design document** (Word doc, design.md, rough notes):
```bash
/design-to-spec projects/{project-name}
```
- Transforms narrative design → structured spec.md
- Adds preliminary ADR references (constraints only)
- Flags ambiguities for clarification
- **Output**: `projects/{project-name}/spec.md` (AI-ready specification)

**OR manually write** `projects/{project-name}/spec.md` with:
- Executive Summary, Scope, Requirements, Success Criteria, Technical Approach

**→ Review spec.md before proceeding to Step 2**

---

### Step 2: Initialize Project (Full Pipeline)

```bash
/project-pipeline projects/{project-name}
```

This orchestrates the complete setup (internal pipeline steps a-f):
- a. ✅ Validates spec.md
- b. ✅ **Comprehensive resource discovery** (ADRs, skills, patterns, knowledge docs)
- c. ✅ Generates artifacts (README.md, PLAN.md, CLAUDE.md, folder structure)
- d. ✅ Creates 50-200+ task files with full context
- e. ✅ Creates feature branch and initial commit
- f. ✅ Optionally starts task 001

**→ Human-in-loop confirmations after each major step**

---

### Step 3: Execute Tasks

**If project-pipeline auto-started task 001** (you said 'y' in Step 2):
- Already executing task 001 in same session
- Continue until task complete

**If resuming in new session or moving to next task** (task 001 is typically auto-started by pipeline step f):
```bash
work on task 002
# OR
continue with next task
# OR
resume task 005
```

**What happens**: Natural language phrases automatically invoke the `task-execute` skill, which loads:
- Task file (POML format)
- Applicable ADRs and constraints
- Knowledge docs and patterns
- Project context (README, PLAN, CLAUDE.md)

**Explicit invocation** (alternative):
```bash
/task-execute projects/{project-name}/tasks/002-*.poml
```

---

### ⚠️ Component Skills (AI Internal Use Only)

These skills are **called BY orchestrators** and should NOT be invoked directly by developers:

| Skill | Purpose | Called By |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| `project-setup` | Generate artifacts only (README, PLAN, CLAUDE.md) | `project-pipeline` (pipeline step c) |
| `task-create` | Decompose plan.md into task files | `project-pipeline` (pipeline step d) |
| `adr-aware` | Load applicable ADRs based on resource types | Multiple skills (auto) |
| `script-aware` | Discover and reuse scripts from library | Multiple skills (auto) |

**Exception**: `task-execute` is also a skill, but it **IS developer-facing** for daily task work:
- Used in Step 3 above: `work on task 001` invokes `task-execute`
- Ensures proper context loading (knowledge files, ADRs, patterns)
- Primary workflow for implementing individual tasks

**When in doubt → Use `/project-pipeline`** (it orchestrates everything)

---

## 🚨 AI Execution Rules (Critical)

### Context Management

| Usage | Action |
|-------|--------|
| < 60% | ✅ Proceed normally |
| 60-70% | ⚠️ Run `/checkpoint` - proactive save, then continue |
| > 70% | 🛑 STOP - Run `/checkpoint`, request `/compact` |
| > 85% | 🚨 EMERGENCY - Immediately run `/checkpoint` and stop |

**Commands**: `/context` (check) · `/checkpoint` (save state) · `/compact` (compress) · `/clear` (wipe)

### Proactive Checkpointing (MANDATORY)

**Claude MUST checkpoint frequently during task execution. These rules are NOT optional.**

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| After every 3 completed task steps | Run `context-handoff` (silent: "✅ Checkpoint.") |
| After modifying 5+ files in session | Run `context-handoff` |
| After any deployment operation | Run `context-handoff` |
| Before starting a complex step | Run `context-handoff` |
| Context > 60% | Run `context-handoff` (verbose report) |
| Context > 70% | Run `context-handoff` + STOP + request `/compact` |

**Checkpoint behavior**:
- Update `current-task.md` Quick Recovery section
- Report briefly: "✅ Checkpoint saved. Continuing..."
- Continue working (don't wait for user unless context > 70%)

### Context Persistence

**All work state must be recoverable from files alone.**

| File | Purpose | Updated By |
|------|---------|------------|
| `projects/{project-name}/current-task.md` | Active task state, completed steps, files modified | `task-execute` skill |
| `projects/{project-name}/CLAUDE.md` | Project context, decisions, constraints | Manual or skills |
| `projects/{project-name}/tasks/TASK-INDEX.md` | Task status overview | `task-execute` skill |

**Resuming Work in a New Session**:

| What You Want | What to Say |
|---------------|-------------|
| Resume where you left off | "Where was I?" or "Continue" |
| Resume specific task | "Continue task 013" |
| Resume specific project | "Continue work on {project-name}" |
| Check all project status | "/project-status" |
| Save progress before stopping | "Save my progress" (invokes `context-handoff`) |

**Full Protocol**: [Context Recovery Procedure](docs/procedures/context-recovery.md)

### Human Escalation Triggers

**MUST request human input for**:
- Ambiguous or conflicting requirements
- Security-sensitive code (auth, secrets, encryption)
- ADR conflicts or violations
- Breaking changes (API contracts, DB schema)
- Scope expansion beyond task boundaries

**Format**: Use 🔔 **Human Input Required** block with situation, options, recommendation.

### Task Completion and Transition

After completing any task:
1. Update task `.poml` file status to "completed"
2. Update `TASK-INDEX.md` status: 🔲 → ✅
3. **Reset `current-task.md`** for next task (clears steps, files, decisions)
4. Set `current-task.md` to next pending task (or "none" if project complete)
5. Report completion and ask if ready for next task

**Important**: `current-task.md` tracks only the **active task**, not history. Task history is preserved in TASK-INDEX.md and individual .poml files.

**Full protocols**: `.claude/protocols/` (AIP-001, AIP-002, AIP-003)

---

## 🛠️ AI Agent Skills (MANDATORY)

**Skills are structured procedures that MUST be followed when triggered.**

### Skill Discovery

**BEFORE starting any project-related work**, check `.claude/skills/INDEX.md` for applicable workflows.

**Skill Location**: `.claude/skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md`

### Trigger Phrases → Required Skills

When these phrases are detected, **STOP** and load the corresponding skill:

| Trigger Phrase | Skill | Action |

| "save progress", "save my state", "context handoff", "checkpoint", "checkpoint before compaction" | `context-handoff` | Load `.claude/skills/context-handoff/SKILL.md` and save state for recovery |

### Auto-Detection Rules

| Condition | Required Skill |
|-----------|---------------|
| `projects/{project-name}/design.md` (or .docx, .pdf) exists but `spec.md` doesn't | Run `design-to-spec` to transform |
| `projects/{project-name}/spec.md` exists but `README.md` doesn't | Run `project-pipeline` (or `project-setup` if user requests minimal) |
| `projects/{project-name}/plan.md` exists but `tasks/` is empty | Run `task-create` |
| Creating API endpoint, PCF control, or plugin | Apply `adr-aware` (always-apply) |
| Writing any code | Apply `spaarke-conventions` (always-apply) |
| Running `pac` commands, deploying to Dataverse | Load `dataverse-deploy` skill first |
| Modifying ribbon XML, `RibbonDiffXml`, or command bar | Load `ribbon-edit` skill first |
| Resuming work on existing project (has tasks/, CLAUDE.md) | Run `project-continue` to sync and load context |

## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

ADRs are in `.claude/adr/` (concise) and `docs/adr/` (full). The key constraints are summarized here—**reference ADRs only if you need historical context** for why a decision was made.

| ADR | Summary | Key Constraint |
|-----|---------|----------------|
| ADR-001 | Minimal API + BackgroundService | **No Azure Functions** |
| ADR-002 | Thin Dataverse plugins | **No HTTP/Graph calls in plugins; <50ms p95** |
| ADR-006 | PCF over webresources | **No new legacy JS webresources** |
| ADR-007 | SpeFileStore facade | **No Graph SDK types leak above facade** |
| ADR-008 | Endpoint filters for auth | **No global auth middleware; use endpoint filters** |
| ADR-009 | Redis-first caching | **No hybrid L1 cache unless profiling proves need** |
| ADR-010 | DI minimalism | **≤15 non-framework DI registrations** |
| ADR-012 | Shared component library | **Reuse `@spaarke/ui-components` across modules** |
| ADR-013 | AI Architecture | **AI Tool Framework; extend BFF, not separate service** |
| ADR-021 | Fluent UI v9 Design System | **All UI must use Fluent v9; no hard-coded colors; dark mode required** |
| ADR-022 | PCF Platform Libraries | **React 16 APIs only; unmanaged solutions only** |

## AI Architecture

AI features are built using the **AI Tool Framework** - see `docs/guides/SPAARKE-AI-ARCHITECTURE.md`.

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `AiToolEndpoints.cs` | Streaming + enqueue endpoints |
| `AiToolService` | Tool orchestrator |
| `IAiToolHandler` | Interface for tool implementations |
| `AiToolAgent` PCF | Embedded streaming AI UI component |

Key pattern: **Dual Pipeline** - SPE storage + AI processing execute in parallel.

## Coding Standards

### .NET (Backend)

```csharp
// ✅ DO: Use concrete types unless a seam is required
services.AddSingleton<SpeFileStore>();
services.AddSingleton<AuthorizationService>();

// ✅ DO: Use endpoint filters for authorization
app.MapGet("/api/documents/{id}", GetDocument)
   .AddEndpointFilter<DocumentAuthorizationFilter>();

// ✅ DO: Keep services focused and small
public class SpeFileStore { /* Only SPE operations */ }

// ❌ DON'T: Inject Graph SDK types into controllers
public class BadController(GraphServiceClient graph) { } // WRONG

// ❌ DON'T: Use global middleware for resource authorization
app.UseMiddleware<AuthorizationMiddleware>(); // WRONG
```

### TypeScript/PCF (Frontend)

```typescript
// ✅ DO: Import from shared component library
import { DataGrid, StatusBadge } from "@spaarke/ui-components";

// ✅ DO: Use Fluent UI v9 exclusively
import { Button, Input } from "@fluentui/react-components";

// ✅ DO: Type all props and state
interface IMyComponentProps {
  items: IDataItem[];
  onSelect: (item: IDataItem) => void;
}

// ❌ DON'T: Create new legacy webresources
// ❌ DON'T: Mix Fluent UI versions (v8 and v9)
// ❌ DON'T: Hard-code Dataverse entity schemas
```

### Dataverse Plugins

```csharp
// ✅ DO: Keep plugins thin (<200 LoC, <50ms execution)
public class ValidationPlugin : IPlugin
{
    public void Execute(IServiceProvider serviceProvider)
    {
        // Validation only - no HTTP calls
        ValidateRequiredFields(context);
    }
}

// ❌ DON'T: Make HTTP/Graph calls from plugins
// ❌ DON'T: Implement orchestration logic in plugins
```

## Commands

| Action | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Build all | `dotnet build` |
| Build API | `dotnet build src/server/api/Sprk.Bff.Api/` |
| Build PCF | `cd src/client/pcf && npm run build` |
| Test all | `dotnet test` |
| Test with coverage | `dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage" --settings config/coverlet.runsettings` |
| Run API | `dotnet run --project src/server/api/Sprk.Bff.Api/` |
| Format code | `dotnet format` |

**API Endpoints**: `https://localhost:5001` · Health check: `GET /healthz`

## File Naming Conventions

| Type | Convention | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| C# files | PascalCase | `AuthorizationService.cs` |
| TypeScript files | PascalCase for components | `DataGrid.tsx` |
| TypeScript files | camelCase for utilities | `formatters.ts` |
| Test files | `{ClassName}.Tests.cs` | `AuthorizationService.Tests.cs` |
| ADRs | `ADR-{NNN}-{slug}.md` | `ADR-001-minimal-api-and-workers.md` |

## Error Handling

### API Responses
- Use `ProblemDetails` for all error responses
- Include correlation IDs for tracing
- Return user-friendly messages (not stack traces)

### PCF Controls
- Use try/catch with user-friendly error messages
- Log errors with context for debugging
- Show inline error states in UI

## Security Considerations

- **Never** commit secrets to the repository
- Use `config/*.local.json` for local secrets (gitignored)
- Use Azure Key Vault for production secrets
- All API endpoints require authentication (except `/healthz`, `/ping`)

## Development Lifecycle

All coding projects follow this process:

| Phase | Description | Artifacts |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| 1. **Product Feature Request** | Business need or user story | Feature request document |
| 2. **Solution Assessment** | Evaluate approaches, identify risks | Assessment document |
| 3. **Detailed Design Specification** | Technical design, data models, APIs | Design spec (.docx or .md) |
| 4. **Project Plan** | Timeline, milestones, dependencies | `plan.md` in project folder |
| 5. **Tasks** | Granular work items | `tasks/*.poml` in project folder |
| 6. **Product Feature Documentation** | User-facing docs, admin guides | Docs in `docs/guides/` |
| 7. **Complete Project** | Code complete, tested, deployed | Working feature |
| 8. **Project Wrap-up** | Cleanup, archive, retrospective | Run `/repo-cleanup` |

### 🤖 AI-Assisted Development

For new projects, use `/design-to-spec` then `/project-pipeline`. See [Project Initialization: Developer Workflow](#-project-initialization-developer-workflow) for the complete workflow.

### Before Starting Work

1. **Check for skills** - Review `.claude/skills/INDEX.md` for applicable workflows
2. **Identify the phase** - What lifecycle phase is this work in?
3. **Check for existing artifacts** - Look for design specs, assessments
4. **Follow the workflow** - If a design spec exists, run `/design-to-spec` then `/project-pipeline`

### Working Checklist

**Before making changes:**
- Check ADRs align with your approach
- Review `.claude/skills/INDEX.md` for applicable workflows

**After completing work:**
- Run tests (`dotnet test`)
- Update task status in TASK-INDEX.md
- Update docs if behavior changed
- Run `/repo-cleanup` to validate structure
- Use small, focused commits

## Module-Specific Instructions
